Hi guys , the following folder contains seperate .sav, .pkl and .ipynb(notebooks) for all the three algorithms that is performed on the data.

If you want to access the .ipynb notebook kindly open it online on google colab.

Follow this link for colab tutorial:

Kindly note that pipelining was tried on countvectorizer and the algorithms by referring to the documentation , but it didnt proove of much a help. I suggest kindly look for a different way to handle backend or find some efficient solution to this issue Abhish Anand, as i could n't find a way to do it.

Find the documentation for pipeline(the one is referred):
