i think i

i think i loved this boy...ive known him and liked him for a long time...we tried the dating thing in the past and it didn't work...but this time...we both said we really wanted it to work...and it did for a while...at least id like to think it did...i was delieriously happy...more so than ever before...but he decided to break things off because i was distracting him from getting his life together...so once again he walked out of my life...i don't know if i was ever given the chance again if i would be with him again...i love him but i hate being left...
