i just separated

i just separated with this guy, and my parents keep thinking that i'm crying over him because my eyes are always puffy and red. They don't know that I"m bulimic and constantly throwing up causes me to look like that. I'd rather him think that way than suspect that i'm doing such harm to my body.
