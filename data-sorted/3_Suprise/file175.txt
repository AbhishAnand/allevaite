hate turned forward

i've decided that even though i hate eveyone (aside from a few personal closies), i still want to be here and be personable. and what finally brought me round is a weekend at home cleaning my home and growing my plants, come end of the summer i'll have tomatoes, chives, basil, green pepper and cilantro. it's nice to look forward to my tiny weeny plants growing into less grocery shopping, and you know what? it makes a difference in this extrinsicly motivated society.
