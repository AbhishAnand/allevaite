Eragon

I started playing Eragon on xbox 360 today at like 7:00 am and waited for some people to come to my house. It was at like 5:30 pm when I finished the game and realized I had all of the achievements. I don't know why I played through so much of the game, I didn't even care about the achievements after like 10 minutes, but some strong outside force compelled me to sit through one lousy level and generic story cutscene after another. I felt violated and immediatly took a shower when it was over, but it didn't help in the long run because it's still on my gamercard.
