Hit a Parked Car

I accidentally hit a parked car while I was trying to park today. I felt like a total idiot. I got out and checked the bumper of the other car and there was absolutely NO damage. However, I am absolutely terrified that someone may have seen me do it and called the cops. Now I am terrified that the cops will come and arrest me.
