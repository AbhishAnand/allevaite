I can't drive because no one wants to teach me, except my Dad who lives 50 miles away from me and did a very poor job teaching me last time I went over there. My brother drives a stick which I refuse to learn due to, once again, fear of breaking the car by clutching wrong. Since I know that it kills the transmission if you grind. And I fear that me not being able to drive has been really getting in the way of things... Especially trying to get a job.
