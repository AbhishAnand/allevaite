BOYs

well... I've been going out with my boyfriend for over a year now, but recently I've made a great friend with this amazing guy. My boyfriend realises that this guy would funnily be a perfect match for me, even more than he is. The problem is, I am always thinking of this other guy and not my boyfriend. This guy can make me laugh and smile a lot more then my boyfriend can. This guy is intelligent, funny, good looking, but also we have the same beliefs. I really am confused, and now, even his friends realise that this guys would be a better boyfriend for me...I don't know what on earth to do! if i break up with my boyfriend then it will break his heart. Should I stay with him? Even if I broke up with my boyfriend to go out with this guy.... so i wouldn't be in a better position, in fact I would be in a worst situation, as it would mean I wouldn't be able to talk to this guy at all! as he is my boyfriends friend... sorry for boring whoever has read this! but, this is my situation and i needed to get this off my chest and out into the open! thanks!
