Interview

I had a job interview, and I didn't really give it my best shot. I'm under a lot of pressure right now, or at least I was when I went on that interview, and the pressure made me think that I didn't want the job. But now that I realize I do want the job, I know I sabotaged my chances. It's not that I gave a bad interview, I just know I didn't give a good one, and I could have. My job field is very competative, and this would have been a great opportunity for me. Now that I didn't distinguish myself, I'm upset, but I have no one to talk to about it. No one would really understand. I just got scared and thought it would be better if I didn't get the job. Now I don't know what to think or feel. Will anyone read this and understand? I can't explain to anyone just what I'm feeling.
