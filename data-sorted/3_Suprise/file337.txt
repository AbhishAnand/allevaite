stealing

I worked at the same place for 5 years and took money all the time. It was just so darn easy. By the end I was taking at least 50 bucks a shift. The worst part is I really don't feel bad about it. Now I don't work there and I'm so poor all the time, I'm not used to living without the extra income. I guess it serves me right.
