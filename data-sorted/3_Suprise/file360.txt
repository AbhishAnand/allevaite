Triangle

I'm stuck in a love triangle right now with my best friend and a very attractive girl, Now she likes him i like her and he likes some other. Now the girl I have confessed my feelings to her and yet she remains confused and does know which one she wants. yet she told me and her couldn't happen. so I'm at a party with her and my friend, and it tends to get wild VERY wild and the music took people over and I saw her just up and kiss him in front of me. Now thats my man's I should be proud of him, But at the same Time I want to just beat him in, Until theres nothing left. But Like I've said he's my BEST friend and I would die for this guy, I would challenge anything for both his honor and life, But and the same Time I want to be the very person who tries to kill him, I really have feelings for this girl, BUT IN the end all I want to do is let go and move on and just go for another fish in the sea and put this be hide me as a big step in life. So I ask you people of just being out there Should I be mad or should I be happy?
