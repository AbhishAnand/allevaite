Fiance 'needs time'

After 3 years of dating, she brings up that everything I complain about really bothers her... that I'm still in school, currently have no job, have unrealistic goals... etc. (Except that I am avidly looking for employment, have LOTS of goals, but they cannot be accomplished until I have my 4 year degree, oh, and I just 4.0'd a year of classes. She says she needs time, but to wait for her. I've been trying to talk it out with her for a month over why she feels this way... and two months ago was content and happy and estatic over planning our wedding. Leave me or don't... just don't leave me sitting here.
