First Comes Love, Then Comes...
Every time I start to date a new person, I always consider whether or not I could marry them, what marriage would be like, raising kids, the whole mess. It doesn't matter how long we haven't been together--I can't stop my brain from running through scenarios. I've only been dating my current boyfriend for two months and already I picture us blissfully wed. It's just neurotic and more than a little creepy.
