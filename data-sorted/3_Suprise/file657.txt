Work

I have been managing a small hedge fund that has recently lost a lot of money 90%. The clients do not know as I intend to make it back, although, 2 are looking to get out of it entirely. And they happen to be my biggest investors. I do not have the capital though and am afraid to tell them as I have a family to provide for.
