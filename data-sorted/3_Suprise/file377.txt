Single, now what?

I broke up with my boyfriend because I felt like I had to date other people. Now I am once again depressed about my hair and body, and for some reason this guy that's in a relationship is flirting with me (I think) and I don't regret breaking up, but this is all so new to me and I don't feel like I have any respect
