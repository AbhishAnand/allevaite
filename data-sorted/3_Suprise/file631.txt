I never got

I never got closure from a girl and its beginning to bug because I get mad when I see her with other guys. I don't talk to her anymore but I see her almost everyday walking by the student center. She doesn't bother to say hi nor do I, I still like her but it seems as though she has moved on. It seems as though she fooled me. Was I fooled by the antics of sorority girls? What do I do now? I read her away messages daily and she has petty love notes to other guys. God, what the hell
