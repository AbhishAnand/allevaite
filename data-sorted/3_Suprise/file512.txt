Wish You Were Mine

I think about you every day. I love your sand-blonde hair, your blue eyes, your personality, your humor, your taste in music... you're simply perfect in every way possible. I'm madly in love with you. I wait for hours so I can talk to you online. I anxiously await your arrival at my door when you walk home from track. And when you leave, I love driving you home just so we can talk alone and together - even if it's only 3 blocks from my house. I think about you at work, at school, and every night before I fall asleep. I even dreamed that we made out... it was wonderful. It felt so real, and I wish it could have lasted a lifetime. I wish I could be with you, protect you, and keep you forever. But the problem is that I'm 4 years older than you. It kills me that I have to wait to even tell you how much I love you. The fact that I'm 19 and you're 15 is just... unreal to me. I don't feel 19, I don't look 19... I'm always told this. So why can't it be? If you happen upon someone else, I don't know what I'd do. What if someone asks you to prom, and you accept? What if it goes further than that, and I can't do anything to protect you from that person, because in my heart I know that the I am the only person who feels like I can truly keep you safe. I know you feel something towards me as well, because every time we're together I sense that extremity in our friendship - that certain aroma of love. Perhaps one day we will be together. Jaclyn, I love you and I wish you were mine.
