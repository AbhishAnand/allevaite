I know I shouldn't but...
I am trying so hard to get over him...I was doing really well until...that day. I shouldn't be paying such close attention to his day~to~day moves, but I miss him and hate that my walking away from him meant nothing and he probably doesn't even miss me...God please forgive me for what I have done in trying to relieve myself..it really wasn't so bad...I haven't hurt anyone...yet
