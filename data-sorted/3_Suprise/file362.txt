I really wish

I know you've said years ago and time and time again that your sure you NEVER wanna work or go back to school ever again but I feel someday you will regret this decision. I understand know you don't like people complaining at you for the stuff you've done in your life. Frankly I don't blame you. But honestly I need to put my two cents in. You dropped out of high school four years ago. And up until the last year or so you harldly left your house. You haven't worked anywhere or volunteered or been on any trips. Hell you barely even socialize with your own family members. As your closest friend I know I will someday develop the courage to tell you these things. It's sooo inconsiderate on your father and all the others who care about you. And personally as my best friend I really wish you'de stop this.
