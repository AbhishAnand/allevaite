Olsan's Revenge

I was married and divorced a short time later. My husband remarried and had a baby a few years after our divorce. I was furious and jealous. I started sending nasty hateful emails to my ex and his new wife. When he responded, I showed my boyfriend how crazy my ex was. I soon told people that he was stalking me and made our friends make their websites private so that he couldn't stalk me. I even went so far, at the urging of my boyfriend, to call the police on my ex. I have since married my boyfriend and have three children. I continue to tell people that my ex stalked me so they will all think that he is crazy.
