Strange Thoughts

I live in a fairly large apt complex, and I have noticed this 5-7 yr old boy roaming around. I keep having urges to scare this kid. Not hurt or anything so drastic, but maybe scare him. Why? i have a 2 year old myself that I would never harm or scare! I probably would never try to scare the kid in real life, but its weird that the thoughts run through my head!
