Love or studies?

I love my boyfriend, or so i think. I truly believe i do, even if it isn't love, its something strong that i feel. However, im just scared about the future. We'll both be going to university soon and he keeps on bringing me down when we mention it, as we both realize that i will be hard for us to stay together during this period. I promised him we'd stay together. However, now looking back, i dont think I can promise that... is it impossible to look into the future?
