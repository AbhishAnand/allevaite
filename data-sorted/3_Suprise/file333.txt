I love a married woman that isn't my wife

I've recently reconnected with an old friend/girlfriend. We were always close and connected on a very deep level, but I was too stupid and self-centered to commit to her. We fell out of touch for a long time. I've been married for over 13 years with 2 kids and thought I was happy... until I started chatting with my friend again. She's recently married and I want so badly to break them up so she'll be with me. I've realized that I don't really love my wife anymore and never loved her on the same level as my friend. But I don't want to hurt my kids. The pain of being seperated from my friend is almost unbearable. We chat every day. I should feel guilty, but I don't. I think about my friend even when I kiss my wife and tell her I love her. I fantasize about leaving her.
