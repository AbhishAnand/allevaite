Guilty and Sad
I accidentally cut my hamster when I was grooming him. I feel horribly guilty! He has a big open wound now and I don't know what to do! I have cleaned it and medicated it, but I can't get over how careless I was. I am truly and terribly sorry! But I still feel awful! I regret it! I have cut his hair before cause he gets feces stuck in it, but this time he moved and that's how i cut him. =(
