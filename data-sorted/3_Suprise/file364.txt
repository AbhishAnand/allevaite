I feel I'm in Crisis

I've been married for seven years and I get disgusted when my husband touches me. He is a good person, I'm just not in love with him anymore. I want to leave, but I don't know if I can handle it financially and honestly I don't think he'll let me go. I have a crush on someone else, but I don't want to ruin my family. I don't even know how this other person feels about me. But I can't stop thinking about this person, and we are on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. I want to get the crush out of my head. I just want out of my marriage. I just want to focus on me and my kid. I just don't know how.
