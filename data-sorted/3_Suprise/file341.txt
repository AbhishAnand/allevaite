settling

I think I'm settling. I've been with a guy for 3 years. We broke up last year and were both heart broken, so we got back together. Things are much better but I feel like in the long run, we're not meant to be, we're just too different. I'm sure people look at us and wonder what I'm doing with him. Now we're getting a place together and talking about marriage. I know now is the time to get out, but I'm not going to. What a dumb girl I am.
