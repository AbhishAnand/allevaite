The only time I feel alive is when my heart is breaking.

I look for heartbreak, because it's the only time I can cry, or feel anything. I will do anything to be crushed by a guy so I can JUST. FEEL. Otherwise, I am so numb to the world. Nothing hurts, nothing scars. Nothing makes me care. I just want to feel.
