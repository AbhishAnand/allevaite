My nose won't stop growing
I don't know why but I can't stop myself from telling a lie.. it can be about the stupidest things too. I tell lies to make stories sound better, to make people laugh, to get attention. I want to stop but I am afraid that people wont' like me as much. I am known as the funny laid back kinda person and I really don't want to be known as a liar to.
