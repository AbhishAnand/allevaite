Cheating
One night he came onto me, so I decided I'd see where it would go. Soon enough it turned into a big deal, and we were seeing each other almost every day behind my boyfriend's back. Finally the pressure got to me, and I broke up with my boyfriend. Although, when I realised I loved him, I got back together with him almost straight away. I decided I'd end it with his friend. But before I could do that, his best friend ended it with me after somebody found out.
