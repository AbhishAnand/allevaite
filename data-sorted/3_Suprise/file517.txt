I still wonder...

I'm engaged and completely in love with the person I'm going to marry. But a long time ago while I was still in this current relationship, there was another man I was very interested in. And he was definitely interested in me. I was very tempted to cheat, but didn't. I was really thinking about leaving my current fiance for this other man, but didn't. Sometimes I wonder if I should have. They are both really great guys, but I guess I'll always wonder if it could have been better with the other one. I'm getting married soon, so I guess I'll never know.
