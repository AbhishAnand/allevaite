MMORPG
I was addicted to WoW. After work, it was the only thing I did. Social life went close to zero. Then I quitted because my friends ad family supported me to do so. Now it has been a year and I still dream and think about it, how much I want to go back to Azeroth. But I promised I would never play it again. I fear I'm going back very soon.
