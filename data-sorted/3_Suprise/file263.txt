No body understands

It all starts when I hear stories about an innocent girl, afterwards I become obessed, because I really wanna date somebody who is still innocent and pure, who would give me the old love type with nothing in return, but as I always say! dreams are for rookies....It was going ok! I simply walked the walk, and simply talked the talk, all her looks, and way and stickin around with my friends made me feel comfortable a little, but I felt something is missing, days after, she was so different! she was just cold, but its my fault, when I think that I love somebody I don't intend to play mind games with her, I was honest and all my actions had been saying to her that she's different to me, and this is where I got stiffed...I guess my type weren't meant to find true love...but I confess I want dearly to find true love, and I guess I could've loved this girl...T13
