I am rather

I am rather compulsive about school and taking too much classwork. It is often in a selfish or vain context and the pressure is too much from people, parents, but... most of all myself. I do think I lack the focus to really achieve what I am set out to do, that is, complete a double major in three short years, and as such I am always going to be unsatisfied with my work. It is already half way over and I don't know what to make of things.

Music is a nice excape, but there are many things I have sacrificed for this goal: a job, my own wellbeing, friendships, a relationship perhaps, and at times my own happiness and simple routine. But at any rate my priorities are all out of place, school, exercise, relaxation, lovelife, parents and family, it's a mixed jumble and I hardly see how I get anything done. Not to mention for all this I am rather lonely, and perhaps I think my life is empty because of this grind. That is all...
