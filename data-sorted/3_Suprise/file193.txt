cheater

I just cheated on my husband for the first time ever. We have been together for almost ten years and something like this would never have crossed my mind. It felt so good in the moment. The worst part is I don't even feel bad about it. It was amazing to feel someone different inside me. I wish he wasn't leaving. I don't want to get attached to someone it's highly unlikely to have a future with.
