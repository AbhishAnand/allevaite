it's like someone told me

for as long as I can remember I have known i will die before I am 30. I just turned 20 years old a few days ago and on the day of my birthday i was drilling with my National Guard unit. That same day they told me I will be going to Iraq. Not that I want to die, but I think I will never see the united states of america again after I leave on deployment. that said, i have started writing letters to everyone that is important to me in my life. maybe that is naive of me.
