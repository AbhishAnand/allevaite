Ex Is DALEEEEEETED!!!

I set up Facebook accounts for my husband and myself. He doesn't check his, but I log in every once in a while and let him know who has added him, etc. Tonight I noticed that his old college girlfriend had e-mailed him. This is an ex that he was having regrets about when I first met him (years ago, but whatever), and I just don't want to deal with that. I scoped out her profile, deleted the e-mail and changed his privacy settings so she can't look him up anymore.
