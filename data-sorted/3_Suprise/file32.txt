Typical
He's 33, I'm 17. He USED to be my teacher. I don't see a problem, I don't think that he sees much of a problem. But he hasn't kissed me yet and I want him to kiss me so god damn much. He came on holiday with me and my friend for four days and I realised how great we are for each other, how much we click. I'm so scared that we will never happen and we will have both walked past the best thing in our lives.
