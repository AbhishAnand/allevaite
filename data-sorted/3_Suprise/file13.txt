stolen car
I stole a car that was a friend of mines mothers while they watch me do it. They didn't see me enough to know who I was but they watch as someone drove away with thier car. My friend was distracting them when I did it.. They never found out who did it. We left the car after we had some fun with it and it took about 2 weeks before the cops found it.
