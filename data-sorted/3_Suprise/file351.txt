i'm a wuss

I still love her, and everyday i give her advice on how to make her relationship with him better. I want so bad to just break into her house and tell her how i feel, i want to tell her the truth but i feel that wouldn't be fair to her. It's been a year and i've dated other girls and i still love her. I don't think she loves him, i think she's just afraid to break up with him. Everytime i'm in town i sit outside her house in my car planning to just tell her how i feel, but everytime i just wuss out. I drive fast going home hoping some car will hit me just so i can end this stupid way i feel about this stupid girl.
