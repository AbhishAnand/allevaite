i had a falling out with my best friend in high school. we had a nasty fight about how extremely selfish and mean she can be and what not. we didn't speak again til the first or second year in college, but of course that reminded me why we stopped being friends. we haven't spoken since. i know she reads my away msgs and other things using someone else's sn. i read her online journals from time to time just to see what she's up to. we were the best of friends, but seriously, that's over now. why do we still check up on each other like that? is it because we still care or we're just curious to know what's up?
