why does he do that

Everytime I go to my boyfriend's house, he wants me to leave at 12:30... but when i say ill get the bus at 1 he says no. I know its stupid, but it makes me feel so lame that he doesnt want me to stay longer. I love him so much and i know he loves me back. but why does he do that?
