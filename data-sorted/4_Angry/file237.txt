this guy hits me

this guy in my school always slaps me in the face and runs away. he doesnt slap all that hard, but nobody sticks up for me. i try to slap him back but he runs away before i know what happened. today, he slapped my butt. when the teacher leaves the room, he comes over to me and starts massaging me and rubbing my legs, so i try to kick him. He even tried to kiss me one time. he's annoying, and i'm only thirteen! i'm afraid to tell a teacher.
