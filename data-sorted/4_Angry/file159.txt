Biggest. Loser. Ever.

My roommates friend is a loser. I hate him with a passion. Seriously, he is the biggest loser I've ever met. I used to think my roommate was a pretty intelligent guy, but his choice of friends and the actions he's taken since making these friends really perplexes me. I hate this particular friend most for turning my friend into something that I don't recognize any more. Something dependent on drugs and alcohol. It's really quite sad.
