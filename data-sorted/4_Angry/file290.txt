play the game everybody play the game

men just suck and are full of lies. they toy with my emotions just so they can be with me. i say i too can play at this game. from now on my relations will be a calculated plan. After all "I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things. We can do the tango just for two. I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings, be your valentino just for you..." watch out boys you have met your match i can make you fall head over heals and not feel a damn thing myself just like you...you jerks have had it coming!
