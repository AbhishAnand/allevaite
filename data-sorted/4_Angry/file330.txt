A nasty man

I hate my husband. He is the meanest, most insensitive, rude, obnoxious, nasty, man anyone can ever meet. I walk on eggshells when I am around him because I never know what will set him off. I try to avoid situations where I have to be in public with him. I have no idea how I ended up with him. I am stuck with him because I don't know how to get away from him. I must have been possessed to marry him. His parents treated him lousy and he never learned love from them. I pray every day that he gets into a car accident and dies or at least becomes comatose that I can unplug him. He's a lawyer and so am I; isn't that crazy? and I can't figure a way out. I have to make sure the two boys don't end up just like him. If you read this, please pray for that car accident...
