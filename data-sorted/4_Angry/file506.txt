I fell in love with someone from Alabama

This summer I fell in love. I was still with my boyfriend. I didn't want anything to happen between us because I was still with my boyfriend. So that's a lie. I was terrified he didn't like me. I knew he loved me as a friend, but did he want me as more than a friend? Since I got back I have been getting drunk and making huge mistakes. I broke up with my boyfriend and promptly made even more mistakes. We just got back together. I want the one boy I can't have. Now he lives to far away. Why didn't I just go for it when I had the chance?
