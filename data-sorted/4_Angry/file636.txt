he's my first

he's my first boyfriend and we've been together for three years. i left to study abroad for a few months and while in rome i met a guy at a club. we danced like i didn't have a boyfriend and he slowly leaned in and kissed me. i kissed back. i knew it was wrong, but at the same time i really wanted to have that experience. i've never kissed anyone else, so curiosity got the best of me. i could have prevented it, but deep down inside i didn't want to so i let it happen. i knew i should have told the guy i had a bf, but i didn't because i didn't want him to stop dancing with me. so after a while it led to kissing. i pulled away though because i felt bad, but then later he kissed me again. i felt really guilty for enjoying it. i never got to say goodbye to that guy in rome that night, so i looked him up on his school directory and emailed him just to let him know i had a good time and to say goodbye. i wasn't even sure if that was his email. i only knew his first name and the school he goes to. i never got a response, but that doesn't matter because i just needed the closure. i still think about him now that i'm back from time to time. it's a great memory and i'm glad i got it out of my system.

i decided not to tell my boyfriend because i know it'd crush him. it's a special memory of my time abroad that i keep for myself. i don't regret my decision of not telling him the truth. there's no point spoiling our relationship over my mistake. i'll never see that guy again and i know it'll never happen again. it was just something about that particular guy, being in rome, and kissing someone for the first time that wasn't my bf. i do feel reallly bad sometimes when he jokingly asks if i met anyone while i was away. i hate having to lie to him.
