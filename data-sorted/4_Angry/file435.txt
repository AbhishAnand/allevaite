I love my mom but hate having her qualities

So everyone tells me that I'm exactly like my mom but i hate it. I hate having her attitude because i hate her attitude when it comes to complaining and being mad. I hate how she is when she's sick...it's so bad and i get that from her too. i hate it. my mom always complains about my dad, and i don't like jsut sitting and listening to her complain. half the time she complains about stuff she shouldn't be complaining about. she's lucky even to have a husband like him around!
