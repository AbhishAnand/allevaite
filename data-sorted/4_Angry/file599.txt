I hate my husband

My husband went to Iraq and came back a completely different person. He refused to seek counselling. It almost ruined our marriage. I tried to understand, but the way he treated me and our daughter caused me to despise him. He started to get better and things were great between us. Now I would like to have another child and he doesn't. I feel myself descending back into resentment for him. Marrying him was the biggest mistake I ever made.
