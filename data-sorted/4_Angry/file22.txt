We had a big fight tonight because he told his friend something I asked him not to, and then it got around. I wasn't so mad at first, but when he apologised about it, I suddenly felt so angry that I refused to talk to him, I didn't answer his txt messages. But when he didn't call, I got even angrier, called him and asked why he didn't even bother to see if I was okay. He apologised, but I just hung up.
