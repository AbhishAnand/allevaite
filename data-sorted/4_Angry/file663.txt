spying

I am married to a great guy, I truely love him. A fews months ago I found a number in his cell phone, it was some girl he had been hanging out with. He promises me they were only friends and nothing happened, but I don't know if I will ever really be able to fully trust him again. We have become closer since then but how do you get past this? I have been maticulous in my searching and spying since then. I look through the phone records and email and anything else to see if I can find any evidence of the two of them talking, she is younger than him and is very FAT. I'm thinner and I think prettier than she is and I'm still angry about it. I have told her to stay away, and I've even thought of spying on her. I know its creepy but I want vendication and revenge. She almost ruined my marriage!!!!!!!
