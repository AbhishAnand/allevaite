I hate most girls I meet

I hate girls when they try to make other girls feel bad about themselves for eating this or ordering that...I am almost 30 and I weight 127 lbs, excercise regularly, eat pretty well (spluring every once in a while) and wear a size 2...and they are still some pathetic girls that make comments about my weight or what I am eating, none of these girls are as thin or healthy as me. I just want to tell them that are fat ugly cows because they deserve it!
