I deserve better

I know that we are supposed to love each other. We've been together three and a half years. But on Wednesday I'm going out with another guy. I wish YOU would take me out and fufill me needs, But I'm starting to wonder if you ever will. You never show up on time anytime we meet up and you come over smelling gross because you haven't brushed your teeth or showered. Its sooo gross its to the point where I don't even wanna be with you. On top of that you always expect money for food, and if I don't buy it for you, you complain like its my fault. I try to tell you these things nicely and then you say mean things like see I told you we're not right for each other." Its not fair how you never have any money or even a phone where I can reach you. Its not fair how you never help me and my mom out. She works two jobs and goes to school and you can't even work one. I'm tired of paying for everything for you including your school which cost me three thousand dollars (which you failed by the way). I know you love me but this needs to stop. And until it does I'm gonna see what else is out there because I deserve better. "
