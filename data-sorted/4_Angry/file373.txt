I just need to get it out

Dear best friend: You are SO bad at being supportive and encouraging. Or maybe I'm just SO good at hiding how much your opinion matters. I shut up because I know you are living such difficult times right now, so I agree to make it all about you. But in the meantime, your silence hurts me and makes me cry when we discuss me. I won't ever tell you for real, but I ache to get it out.
