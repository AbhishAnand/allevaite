Hate

I hate you I hate you I hate you. I don't know why, or when it started. But i can't stand you. When you touch me, I can't even try to hide the dismay on my face. or when you talk to me, I can't help but to reply with something rude. i wish i could stop, i really really do, we used to have such great times, but i can't, and I wish that you could back away again. Or not just back away, leave. Which you will be, but it seems not soon enough. i can't try and be your friend again, because you are leaving, and it makes me sick. i think you are pathetic and wimpy. Your life is far better than anyone I know, and I hate you for thinking that it isn't. I JUST HATE. and I wish i didn't.
