The Typical Cliche, I Suppose.

And it really IS a typical cliche. Screwed-up romance with a high-school setting. Girl goes through school in ignorant bliss, popular - but with all the wrong people. She's sometimes happy, she's sometimes sad - she lives a good enough life to survive on. After a few years of this she sees this guy, whos always been there. . .but it's taken her this long to actually SEE him. She hates him - his cocky sarcasm, his confident arrogance - and yet he won't get out of her head, he just won't. Oh, but if only he didn't hate her as intensely as she hates him. . . Unfortunately, it's so damn impossible for him to return the love. He's gorgeous. Talented. . .at pretty much everything. She's that typical "girl next door" type. Pretty in your average kinda way. Dresses like a total freak. Acts like a dude most of the time. As annoying as hell. Got no girl friends and thousands of guy friends. Oh, but isn't this the beautiful irony of an overused cliche. . . ?
