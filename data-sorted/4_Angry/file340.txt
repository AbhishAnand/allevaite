Slacker grad student

I'm a grad student, but I'm really only doing it because I couldn't get a job without a masters degree. I don't really like my project or care about anything at school. Everyone else in my lab are real keeners, it drives me crazy. Most days I don't even bother to go to school, I go out with my dog or play computer games. I'm scared of what I'll do when I finish, I think everyone probably thinks I'm a horrible student. It sucks because I know I'm capable of great things, I'm just so no motivated.
