The boyfriend's mom

My boyfriend's mom is a sweet lady, except for her annoying habit of sending LONG emails (two pages or more) about updates in her life, what she did this weekend, etc. She sent the long emails to everyone on her address book. I finally decided enough is enough -- I am not going to take this anymore so I went online and signed her up on every e-newsletter and junk mail I can get my hands on. I know she is a very conservative woman so I made sure to subscribe her to sites she would find offensive. Lesson of the day: You mess with fire, you get BURNED, lady!!
