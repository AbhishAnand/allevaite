Second, I know a large part of the reason I rather unceremoniously dumped said ex had to do with the fact that, while I loved him and (wince with me) still do, I was not physically attracted to him. After years, to be so shallow about looks that won't last anyway is horrible. As much as I publically protest otherwise that looks should never matter, they do to me. Worse yet, I was even a little embarassed by the reactions we'd get: "Why are they together? Why is she dating him?" And it's not that I'm God's gift to men. Apparently we all date within our general level of attractiveness and if someone dates higher or lower, people talk. It's cruel, it's shallow, and everyone does it. Don't just denounce me--take a good, hard look in the mirror and then tell me you don't make dating decisions on some of the same criteria.
