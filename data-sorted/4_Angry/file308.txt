Ugly

my whole life was a struggle with my appearance, i always thought i was ugly, when i was about 9 a bully type person called me ugly. Through out all this ppl would say i was beautiful, or tell my mom. When i started going online about 3 years ago and put up pictures on myspace, i got bombarded with compliments. PPl think i model, i had many men like/love/ me jut form what they saw. I broke some hearts. I hate that boy, because in all the beautifuls, there is still that one ugly that ruins it all. I wished awful things on him, he is a loser, does drugs and whatnot, part of me hopes he gets busted and goes to jail, or that he has a stroke and is damaged for life.
