My messy ways drive him crazy

But I really think the problem is his. And further to this, he complains with such frequency that i now no longer have any desire to tidy up at all. Let me make this clear. i'm not dirty. I use soap, water and clean up any food or nasty wastes - but I am messy. i leave stuff out, throw my clothes on the floor and fill our 2nd bedroom with junk I'm too lazy or strapped for time to put back. He's a little dirty. His idea of clean is to put stuff away but to never actually remove dirt. Except vaccuuming. If we had hardwood with and area rugs though, he would totally sweep everything under the rugs. He shoves things continously into drawers, with no rhyme or reason, and then complains when they break. He took photos of all my messy things (purse, table, floor near table, 2nd bedroom). When I saw them I want to alternately yell or laugh. 1) Doesn't he have homework to do? 2) what's he going to use them for? evidence at the divorce trial? I mean, dude will take a bath in a grimy tub and use a nasty germ infested sink but somehow I'm the bad guy because I'm a bit of a clutterbug? Let the record show that I actually clean all the sinks, toilets, screens, windows and cupboards. I do this every week, without complaint. all he does is complain. If he keeps this up, I'm going to remove all my things and make the house completely museum-like. Then I'm going to leave him.
