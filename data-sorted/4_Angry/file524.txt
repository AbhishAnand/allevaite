The Ex

Its been a whole month and I miss him eventhough I dumped him. There were guys before him but I never missed them like this. This one said all the things I NEEDED to hear. I knew I was broken when I walked into this relationship and he said "maybe it takes someone like me to love you". That was the most perfect line anyone ever said to me and because of that damn line, now I'm stuck and just can't seem to move on. It sucks because I need to move on, I cannot let a man disrupt my concentration on the most important thing in my life: My career. I just want all the missing and the pain to stop because I made this choice, I just want the whole emotional whirlwind to just stop!
