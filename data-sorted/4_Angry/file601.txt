I hate my best friends

I have to admit I hate my 2 best friends, they are immorale, dishonest, selfish, mean and down-right piggish in the way they live their lives. I go about every thing normal every day although when I talk to them or see them they make my skin crawl. I only hang out with them for social reasons but I think they are both pigs.
