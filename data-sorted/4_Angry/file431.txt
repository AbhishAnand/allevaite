I really hate her..

So me and this girl were friends from our jr. year of HS till Sept. 07 ( for 6 years). I broke off the friendship because she started to copy me a lot and want to be like me. So much it reminded me of the movie "single white female" SERIOUSLY. She even cut her hair like me! So anyway...I just hate her. She is the one that screwed with my life, and tried to compete with me, and I am the one getting the "fuzzy end of the lollypop" What the heck? was Karma misdirected? She is turning people against me..telling them lies..and they believe her!!!! I just don't get it? I don't usually hate people. I really hate her though..I really do. I just want to beat her down. Give her a good right hook. I have never been so angry in my life. I hate her.
