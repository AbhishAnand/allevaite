frustrating...

We have been in the same class 3rd to 7th grade. We never spoke to each other but I have had a crush on him since about 4th grade. I never saw him since 7th (only once from a distance on the street). I'm now in 11th grade, only had one stupid boyfriend for a few days 3 years ago, never even kissed a guy. I can't stop thinking about him. I want him so much but in reality I don't even know him and he probably doesn't remember me. I can't find anyone else I like. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places... It's so frustrating!
