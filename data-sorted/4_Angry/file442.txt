hope her ticket doubled

This old roommate of mine had a bad bad falling out. We absolutely hate each other. I happened to see her car, and I'm positive it was hers, parked one day on the side of the street by my house. She had a parking violation ticket on the front windshield. Well, I know that if you don't pay a parking ticket in 3 weeks or so, it will double in price, soooo I walked right over and quickly grabbed it off the car. If she never knew about it then she would never pay it in three weeks, right? hahaha hope her ticket doubled.
