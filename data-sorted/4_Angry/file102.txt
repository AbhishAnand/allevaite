the witch

i know someone who i trusted but was making things difficult and tried to hook my guy, so that name really means scum to me. whenever i think of her i think of hurting her. the thought of her suffering makes me happy, and if there wasnt any law on it i will hunt her down and shoot her like how they shoot rats in the alley. i have never hated someone so much before, maybe because of years and years of trust that i gave her even though she was not a good friend. when i finally realised her disgustingness, i was so angry i vowed to make her whole existence miserable from now on. i spam mailed her and am thinking of spreading rumours about her. i will never want to see her happy or rise up again. hopefully she ends up in a mental ward. i would wipe her off existence if i could.
