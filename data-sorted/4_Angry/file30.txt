Parking Lot Provocation
Snowplows had piled snow around the perimeter of the parking lot, so I took extra care to leave room for another car to park next to me--I parked over as far as I could without getting too close to the car already parked to my right. When I returned to my car, sure enough another car had pulled into the space, but they had done such a sloppy park job that there were only about 4 inches between our rear fenders, and only about 10 inches between our front fenders. I could barely squeeze between our two cars when I trudged through the snow from the front. It appeared the other driver had left him/herself ample room to exit the car on the driver side, but obviously they didn't consider how I was going to get into my car. I was so upset --especially after I had tried to be considerate enough to leave them room--that I swung the door open as hard as I could into their door. I grabbed a piece of paper from my purse and wrote a cryptic note saying that it was unfortunate they had been so inconsiderate in the way they had parked because I couldn't enter my car without dinging their door. Then I stuck it under their windshield wiper. With great difficulty (I'm recovering from a back injury), I climbed through the passenger side of my car and over the console. Once in the driver's seat, I swung my door open again as hard as I could against the side of the other car, leaving a small crease.
