I always feel like my attitude is the reason for all of this, I'm a very sarcastic person. I have a hard time being serious about anything in person because as I was raised, I was raised around people who taught me just to not care about anything. Shrug it off. Say "OK" to irrelevant things. Mock those who dwell on unimportant things or say silly things. And really... I can't see myself ever stopping doing that either. I saw a psych once and he said I'm perfectly OK, that I'm just a leader who doesn't quite know how to be a leader.
