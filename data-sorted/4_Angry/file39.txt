i don't wanna hear
you talk about me being annoying when i am drunk, if i keep my mouth shut when you make me wanna shoot myself when you're wasted, because i'm a good friend. it also hurts to hear that yall talk about me as annoying when i had the biggest let down in my life, while i was there holding you for yours. and i always will be. i hope you feel terrible and don't know what to say to me. i sometimes wish i could die, just so everyone would realize what they were to me was nothing like i was to them.
