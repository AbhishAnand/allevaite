What's wrong with me?

i always seem to be attracted to people i really shouldn't go after. most often someone a friend likes as well or worse, someone an ex might have known. i'm not stupid, it's blatantly obvious that the reason i'm doing this is because i know i shouldn't. it's not that i don't have feelings for these people, i just think they get exaggerated because of the heightened risk in the situation. i just spent the night with someone that would probably ruin my friendship with both a friend and an ex. i know i feel terrible today, but sooner or later that will fade and i'm afraid i'm going to do it again. i wish i knew how to stop myself or why i do the things i do. this pattern shows up in all parts of my life in one form or another. i seem to always be deceiving, and in the end hurting the ones i love. i wonder how many people around me i will have to lose before i learn from my mistakes.
