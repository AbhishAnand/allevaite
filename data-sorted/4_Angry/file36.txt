My friends though? I can't stand them. Usually hanging out with them is alright, but once it comes to talking to them online. All I hear is attitude and backtalking. For instance... we were suppose to go to the mall and pick up a game, and about at 4:00 PM, I get a message from her, telling me that she's at my other friends house, giving me some excuse as to why she stood me up. That friend in question also bugs me, cause he's spoiled rotten. He lives with his grandma who spoils him, buying him a 42 inch LCD TV, a computer worth well 1,200 dollars, just about any game he wants, his grandpa gave him his truck... It just pisses me off since my family has no money at all, yet they spend theirs frivolously.
