My Boyfriend
My boyfriend is ugly, but he treats me so good, we tell each other that we love each other, but i dont mean it and i feel bad because i know he does... and he cheated on me 2 months ago with this girl and now she is pregnant... i have his passwords to his msn and everything and he doesnt know that i use his account to creep on my ex's he would be pissed, he is so jealous all the time of all my guys friends every though i assure him he has no reason to be jealous my best friends knows the whole situation and wants me to leave him but i dont want to, i care about him and want to be with him but at the same time i want so much to get away from him, he drives me insane!!!!
