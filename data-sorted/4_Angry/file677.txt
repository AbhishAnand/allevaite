revenge is sweet

I once ran in to an old girlfriend who dumped me days before my junior prom. I was shattered. My friends weere going and at the time it appeared I was not. Months later I ran in to the dumper who was working at a McDonalds tending the register. I ordered a large Coke --- "with no lid" When she gave me the coke I poured it over her head. To say she was pissed would be an understatement. As the coke was dripping down her face, back, chest, etc, I hm sure I had the look of delight on my chops. She muttered something and left her register. The sweetest part of the story was I told the replacement cashier I spilled my coke and she gave me a new one. I felt a sense of vindication like I have never felt since.
