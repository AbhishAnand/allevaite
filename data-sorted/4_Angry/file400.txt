i don't love him

man do i have something to tell. I don't love my x boyfriend. And to tell the truth he was only really in the picture because it was easy and practical for me. he lived down the block and he would walk my dog for me when i was at school or working. Now I just want him gone. He isn' t every smart, I thought he might have some common sense and boy was i wrong. He writes like he speaks and puts the wrong verb tense and other things. It drives me crazy. He is also an "Indian giver" no offense given. He bought me a few outfits through out the relationships and now he wants them back. For what just so that I wont have them. So childish. I gave him things and haven't asked for them back. you give out of love not because they are with you. wow. But you wanna know something I don't care. He can be like that he's get his in the end. That's why Ive found some one else, better. In bed much better. He is a go getter that is what i want. so long you
