Tyrant Boyfriend

My boyfriend is a tyrant 100%! The definition as published by American Psychological Association (APA) states a tyrant is a sovereign or other ruler who uses power oppressively or unjustly. He is without a doubt UNJUST and he even though he believes he is, he is NOT my ruler. He seems to go about his business thinking otherwise but I will NOT be ruled by anyone, especially him. He has the most WHACKED sense of right & wrong and the meaning of FAIR! I am trying to see my way out of this without injury for he is physically much larger in size than me. Why? Well he just informed me that if he saw a popular game site that I subscribe to (i pay a monthly fee for it but i'm not allowed to play it?!) on my computer screen, he would destroy my computer! Which btw I just put back together after he completely trashed my room two days ago. He put a hammer through my dead mother's trunk, broke a stack of dishes, etc. I am not a violent person and this degree of fighting left me shaking like a leaf. I became posessed during the fight and threw a smoking device at his head which I am happy to say left a lump and a mark. In the end we both found that part humorous. I just have to be smart and figure out a way to get him out of my space and keep me bruise free. Wish me luck...
