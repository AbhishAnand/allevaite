It was me

I have a love/hate relationship with one of my best friends. She is a sweet girl when she is not being nasty to people. She looks down to other people and is constantly saying hurtful things about people she dislikes. So one day, she was drunk at a house party and she wouldn't stop calling me and bugging me to come join her. I said no, she'd call five minutes later. My phone was ringing off the hook because she kept calling until I pick up. I was getting real pissed off so I picked up the phone, asked her for the address of the house. I hung up the phone, called 911 and reported her for underage drinking. She got an MIP charge as a result and had to pay a fine. Serves her right.
