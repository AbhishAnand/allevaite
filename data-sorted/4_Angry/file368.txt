I hate myself

I hate myself so much for still loving my ex after all this time. I am using food to hurt myself. I've gained almost 100 lbs in 5 years. This keeps men from being attracted to me and allows me to wallow in self-loathing. I decided today that I really don't want to do this any more, and that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to like myself all over.
