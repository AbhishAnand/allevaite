Old Boss
I used to work for this total dork. The guy would do anything to get ahead, and especially if he could climb over your back to do it. He got transferred, and I sent him a greeting card full of glitter. I wrote in the card, "hey jerk, I'm glad you are gone!" I just wish I could have been there when he opened the card and got pink glitter all over his blue uniform.
