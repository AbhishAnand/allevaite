i have so

i have so much anger, but i don't know towards what. when people do stupid things it annoys me. even tho those stupid things are something that is totally normal. i am at war with myself constantly.
i really fancy a chick but am too afraid to let it show, for i am afriad that our friendship will dull.
i want a relationship, but can't accept one for if i do i am afraid i will miss out my chance with the chick.
