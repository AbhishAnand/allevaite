You walked into my life a stranger a mere eight months ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You are TRULY my gift from a higher power. "Love" is such a small word for what we share. You are amazing. You came into my life when I was at a low point: a time when I thought that the pain brought on by someone else would never end. During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.
