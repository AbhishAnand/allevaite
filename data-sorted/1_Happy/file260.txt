Old friend

We had a rocky friendship. Off and on again. Years without speaking to each other. I want so much to find you and just tell you how much I always loved you. I think I will always love you because this hurt of being without you has never gone away. I tried to tell you once but I don't think you really understood and it's my fault because I've always been with someone else and too scared of being alone to leave and too scared of you rejecting me to come out and tell you straight out. No one can replace you. I've tried. No one can compare.. I close my eyes and I can still see your face. I remember everything you said to me and the facial expressions you used. You live now in my memories only. If I had any artistic talent I would paint you just so I could see your blue eyes every day. You were the best friend I ever had and I wish I could take back all the horrible things I said to you over the years. I just got so frustrated because I've always felt this way about you but I just couldn't bring myself to say it, so I took it out on you and pushed you away. Time after time. Our last fight was about a cat. If you see this. Please find me. I love you.
