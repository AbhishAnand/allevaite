I was very pleased when I learned you had decided to go ahead with my recommendation to decrease the workweek to four nine-hour days. While it is true that this plan will not succeed in some industries, ours seems to be one where the potential benefits merit this bold experiment. I hope the new workweek is as good to you as it has been to me.
