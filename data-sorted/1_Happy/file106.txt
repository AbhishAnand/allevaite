crush on coworker

The first time I saw her, I just about stopped breathing, she was so beautiful. I flirted with her in an awkward way until my boss suggested that it would not be a good idea to start a relationship with a coworker. I wondered if the girl complained to my boss in order to get me to stop flirting, but then she made me a mix cd out of the blue one day, so I think she likes me. I am too scared to ask her out.
