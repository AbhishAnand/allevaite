I'm in love with a coworker

I've known and worked with J for about 1-1/2 years. We've been friends, spent time socially with one another. She even bought me a lap dance at a club once (she went along on the theory that we'd draw more attention with a girl with us than alone, and she was right.) Simply put, I've fallen in love with her. I've seen both her good side and her bad side, but everything seems better when she's around. We have similar views, similar upbringings, and have fun when we are together. She is currently unattached, although there is a (much younger) guy she's been hanging out with and seems to like, and it's pretty clear that she wants a relationship with this guy. We work at a small company, so there's no way a relationship between us could happen. Plus, I'm sure she's not interested, which makes me kick myself in the butt for allowing myself to feel anything for someone I know doesn't reciprocate. I'm old enough to know better.
