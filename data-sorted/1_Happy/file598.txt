Are you going to write back?

E, you are the only one that ever was for me. It's crazy, yes, for I haven't even tasted your kiss and do not know if your feel the same. But I love you. I do love you. I know you and your soul, in spite of not having spent much time together. You've ruined me for all other men. I will never be totally happy without you by my side. And that's impossible, isn't it? We cannot, can we? I will love you forever and keeping you in my daily thoughts, my love.
