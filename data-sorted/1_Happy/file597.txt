beauty

I am so vain that it is hard to get through the day knowing that I am not and will never be as beautiful as I am sure I should be. I am so shallow that I consider myself a superior being, or maybe inferior, either way, different from others in a way that I would describe as a higher state of conscious, mind, intelligence, and of course beauty in most cases. I am either the worst narcissist ever, or if every one is the same as me how can they stand the weight of not being beautiful, because even though I value my self called superior intelligence, I do not doubt that beauty is foremost above everything else in my world/mind/thoughts. Hard to describe, the way I desire beauty, I am not obsessed in a way that I can?t hide all day until I?m alone, but beauty? Truly beauty is the gift of life... And truly I deserve to be the most beautiful being alive.
