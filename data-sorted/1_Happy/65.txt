I loved the way you looked at me the other day. My mouth felt numb, and I stuttered and I couldn't talk. I wished I had the courage to, though, because you're the most beautiful angel I've ever seen. I have been waiting years for you now. I hope I'll be able to talk to you soon. I just don't have the courage to yet.
