I have no patience for incompetent people!

I hate saying this, but I have no patience for people who are lacking in intelligence, education, or just a clue. We have a young woman at our office who's getting training through a job-readiness program, and SHE IS COMPLETELY CLUELESS! I've almost yelled at her several times, and it's only her second day on the job. Everything I ask her to do, I end up redoing because she screwed it up. I know I should have compassion for her ("but for the grace of God" and all that) but I get so irritated with her. What makes it worse is that she's really sweet and really willing to work.
