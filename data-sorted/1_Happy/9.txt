Right after we met, my love, I should have told you this: there's this special love that I have deep within my heart. That love is only for you. It is far greater than this world. I wish I could show you how much you really mean to me. If I could only let you feel how much I really do love you in a kiss or a hug, you would begin to feel the love that I have for you. I will only be able to show you how much I really do love you when we get married. Then you will really know how much I love you. You can hear the sound of my love, though, just by listening to my heart. You can taste the sweetness of my love in a kiss; you can feel it in my embrace.
