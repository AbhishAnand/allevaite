Hey, Baby, I know we haven't been dating very long, but I want you to know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. From the moment I first met you, I knew that I wanted you in my life, whether as just a friend or something more. Baby, I prayed for a long time to find someone like you--someone willing to fight alongside me, someone to make me smile and someone who would truly love me. You're in my thoughts, my dreams, and every breath I take.
