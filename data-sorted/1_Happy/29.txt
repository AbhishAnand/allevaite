We met at work and, in the beginning, you were just someone I worked with. Months passed and all of a sudden my attitude towards you changed and I started to think about you all the time. Our circumstances inhibit us from being together now, but I can't stop obsessing over you. I've never felt like this before, and I don't know what to do. I guess this is a letter recognizing my deep love for you, but at the same I wonder how it can be. I love you with all my heart, and today I have the courage to tell you.
