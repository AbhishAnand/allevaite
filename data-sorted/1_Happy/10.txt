I wake up every morning thinking of you and then I roll over and see your smiling face. I know we can disagree, and I can make you mad, but you still love me with everything you have. I was scared to love you at first, in fear that you would hurt me, but I did anyway, and it's the best choice I ever made. Now, the only fear I have is waking up and rolling over and finding out you were only a dream. If this is a dream world, Baby, then don't wake me up because you're the one and only for me. I love you with everything I have and would give you the very clothes off my back. I love you with all my heart.
