I love Belinda Carlisle

My love for Belinda Carlisle extends far beyond that of physical attraction. Her voice, her lyrics, the heart and rhythm she puts into every note... Her song Summer Rain lifts my spirits to heights. Every time I hear that song, I fan feel the raindrops, I can hear the train. I can feel the gravel, grit and concrete under my foot as I stand on that platform. Its like I am really there. Dancing with her in the summer rain.
