Fake People.

I have come to realize that there are alot of fake people out there. The person who is your best friend all through middle school, won't sit next to you in high school. The person who held your hair back when you were drunk and drove you home, won't be there when you're legal to drink. People change. You have to stay true to who you are and what you believe. Don't make exceptions. Anyone who is worthy of your friendship would never do anything to jeopardize it. Life is too short to have shady people around you. Surround yourself with good people who love you and support you. You have one life to live, make it the best one ever.
