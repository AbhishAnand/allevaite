I am currently in a relationship with a boy i have liked for more than a year now, he's broken inside, and as dumb as this sounds: i like it. not that he's emotionally broken, of course- but that maybe.. i can fix him, like an old house, i suppose. maybe there's something twisted inside of me that makes me love defects...
