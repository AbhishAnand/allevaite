Since I met you, I felt I was living in a new and wonderful world--one full of love. The sun became brighter, the grass greener, and everything I do became more meaningful. You should remember that I will cherish you always. Such love, like everything worthwhile, deserves to be given attention and care in order for it to continue to grow. I hope you agree with me.
