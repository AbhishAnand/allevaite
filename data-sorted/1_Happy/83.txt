It's hard to explain myself or to put it together in one idea; the only easy course is my loving you. For just one look into your eyes makes everything in the world and in my life seem to glow. You make me want to see the sunrise every day, to know it's another day where I could have you by my side. I know faith can make this work someday if I just keep my hopes up. Until then I'll think of you just like now. Your touch will forever caress me with tenderness, and your kisses will keep the flame in my heart alive. I hope that one day soon you and I will be together again.
