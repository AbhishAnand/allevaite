You've walked into my life and totally turned it around. I was so depressed and torn up about what had happened to me in the last year or so that I was ready to give up. You gave me the hope that I needed to keep on going. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I've been waiting for someone just like you to walk into my life. Thank you for everything.
