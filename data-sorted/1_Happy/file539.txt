My Crush.

I've liked the same guy for two years. We're good friends. We do a lot of business together. When we met we we're both in relationships, but now we're both single. We spend a lot of time together, but nothing romantic ever happens. I think its obvious that I like him. Everyone else sees it. Part of me thinks he likes me too. I think we're both so intimidated by each other that we think we don't have a chance. Neither one of us is the type to be rejected. I like him so much. My last relationship ended in part because I could never shut up about him. I look forward to seeing him and his phone calls. I'm like a little girl. I giggle and blush and get butterflies. I love it. I love this feeling. I guess risking losing the pleasure of his company just to bear my soul isn't what I want to do. I'd rather sit here and admire him from afar then never admire him at all. I look at it this way, whatever is meant to be will happen.
