I am still on my knees begging for love, not to a stranger, but to the love I know--you. I've been in love and know its mystery. Each night and day I hope and pray that you'll be mine forever more. After what you've been through, it'll be hard for you to trust again--giving your heart and soul to another's keeping, but know it's me that's on my knees, swallowing my pride, begging you, please--once again, I say, "please," be mine.
