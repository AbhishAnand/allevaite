You once told me that I was a fool for falling for a girl like you! Well, if you feel that way, I accept it. I may be a fool, but the fact remains that I have fallen for you and I can't change that now! I want you to know that I would much rather have you in my life and take a chance on losing you than not taking that chance at all and wondering then, what it would have been like between us! What I'm trying to ask you is--would you take a chance with me? Tanya, will you be my love?

I love you.
