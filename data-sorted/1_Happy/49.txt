You are the reason for my smiles. You are the reason for my tears and the reason for my fears. You, my love, are the reason I wake up each day and go to sleep each night. You are my life. You, my love, are the only reason for my happiness. I love you; I want you; I need you! Life would be incomplete without you. You have given me your love, and I now give you my heart. It is yours to do with as you may, Remember, my love, I am always yours!
