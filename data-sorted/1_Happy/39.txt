When I talk to you, it makes my heart beat faster, and I feel sweet feelings, unexplainable, not understandable. I feel your presence everywhere near me, your laugh echoes in my ears, your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you as much as the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its song, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.
