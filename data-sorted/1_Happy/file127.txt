work

at work i like to steal other peoples food from the fridges. it got so bad that human resources printed out a page to hand around the building stating to watch out for a food theif. i still continued to steal peoples food. i also have a real obsession with stealing things from locker rooms, anything i can find that whether it be clothes or money. i also pooped in the shower once when i got real bad tummy cramps. didnt smell too good.
