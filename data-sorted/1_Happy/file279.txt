I love my dog

I have 3 dogs, 1 of which is a very large german shepherd, who is very protective of me, my family and our home. he has bitten a couple of family friends in the past due to feeling threatened with them in our back garden. i must emphasise this dog is unusually large and can appear ultra agggressive, but is a really fun loving dog and very gentle at heart. about a year ago now i was out walking him near our house across the nearby fields. he was off the lead and wondering along happily. when rounding a hedge row corner we came across a women walking her dog unexpectadly. my dog jumped up and bit her on the arm drawing blood. the women was flustered, i mananged to convince her that it was totally out of character for the dog to bite, it had never happened before and that she must have scared him. within 2 minutes she was convinced it was her fault and couldn't apoligise enough.
