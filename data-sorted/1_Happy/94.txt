I am pleased that you have taken my advice to begin saving through payroll deduction. If you place at least three percent of your gross salary each month into a tax sheltered annuity, the company will contribute another three percent. If you continue your savings and increase them gradually, you will have a very nice retirement income after 30 years. Saving this way was the best advice I received when I joined Doe Corporation, and I am always eager to pass it on to new employees. Best wishes for a happy, prosperous career.
