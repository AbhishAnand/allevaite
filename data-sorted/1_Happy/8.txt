You've got me dreaming about you now. I think of you every second of every day. I can't help it; you have become a part of my world and it's a little scary because I haven't depended on anyone like this for a long time. I would trust you with anything--with everything. I pray that you never do anything to make me regret this. Yes, now I can honestly say that I love you and will always love you because we seem to be soul mates. You say that we were meant for each other and I know that it's true because you say that you love me too.
