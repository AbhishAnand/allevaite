i have everything and i want more

my boyfriend is the best guy in the world. if i were a bit older (im 19) i would probably marry him. he's 21 and has everything going for him. problem is we never see each other. im the type of person that has to have attention all the time. so because i don't get enough protection from him i have to go out and get attention from some other guy. last nite i went out with a guy that i knowingly had a crush on. we made out....nothing more and i feel like poo. i love my boyfriend with all my heart and this isnt the first time i've cheated on him. i do love him with all my heart but breaking up isnt right for me. cause all i want is to see him more and if we break up i'll never see him. i just want him..and i can't have that at the moment. with school and work and everything..we just dont actually have the time. so it's either i sit here and cry all the time or i just try to control myself and just go to school and work. ..i just dont know what to do....
