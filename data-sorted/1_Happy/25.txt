I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.
