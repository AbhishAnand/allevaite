When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person with whom I would share my dreams, happiness, and life. I could not see his face, but he was there. I always felt he was out there. I just needed to find him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to get through life's obstacles. All these years that I have been with others, feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person I am now. I've been sad and alone. Then one day I saw clearly that he was finally here. Here in my world was the man that I had dreamed of and had hoped I would not miss meeting in life--that man is you.
