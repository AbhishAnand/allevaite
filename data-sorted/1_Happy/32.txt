I just had to let you know that these last two days without talking to you have given me time to think about how I really feel about you. I have decided that I am definitely, hopelessly, in love with you. What made me realize this is not because I think about you all the time, although I do. It was how I think about you. Not only do I think about how much I love you, but why, how much, and mostly if I deserve you to love me.
