life.

I used to have this best friend. One day i finally told him that i was in love with him, and surprisingly he loved me too =]. Those days were the best in my life, we would talk for hours and hours, thinking minutes had passed by. Until one day, he just stopped talking to me. I moved on, thinking he was just another jerk. Months have passed since i talked to him, but i will always love him. i Still hang on, thinking something'll happen. When my mind know nothing is going to go on. My heart doesn't accep that answer. When i see he's online, i want to tell him i love him and miss him. But i never get the courage to. I know i can't keep going on like this,and that sometime i will crack. But until then, all i can do is keep it inside. I just hope that nothing bad happens. I can't really hope that. Seeing as he is 20 and i'm underage still. Horrible things that happen in life, an that's one of them. I also have to say that i really want to rip my moms head off. She's making me move halfway across the world, again. What the heck is she thinking, how am i suposed to settle down, and think of what i want to do in the future if she just wants to keep changing personalities.
