Thanks for taking my advice so seriously. Those who learn from others' experience are usually a step ahead of the rest. Purchasing a home within your means now is a wise move. I'm sure you've done the right thing. You're young and will have time to purchase a larger home later. It's important to build equity now. It looks like you have a great future.
