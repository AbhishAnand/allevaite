Every morning I wake up smiling, just because you're beside me. I listen to your breathing and feel the warmth and comfort of just knowing that you're there. My favorite part of the day is when you roll over and hold me. That feeling remains with me all through the day and lasts until the following morning when we do it all over again. I never want that feeling to end. So I write this to you to let you know of my strong love for you.
