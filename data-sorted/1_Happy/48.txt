I love you so much, and my wish finally came true last Saturday, when you first said that you loved me. My heart lifted because it felt so good inside to finally hear the words I had been longing to hear. We had been friends longer than we had been boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm so in love with you now. I promise you this: I will never lie or do anything to hurt you. You make me feel good inside and so happy, too. It's amazing being with you because you're such an amazing person. I don't know what the future holds--that's something only heaven knows. I just know that love you, and I know that I always will.
