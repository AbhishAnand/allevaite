Relationships

So. I feel like all my relationships are messed up. Here's the deal. I've been dating this guy for 3 months. We dated last year for half a year before I screwed things up and ended it. This time though, I really feel like I might love him, but it's just not working out the way I hoped. The guy I'm with is an amazing guy though. He's just the sweetest. But I keep feeling like I'm screwing things up. I've been talking to a few other guys and planning to hang out" with them. I don't feel bad at the time
