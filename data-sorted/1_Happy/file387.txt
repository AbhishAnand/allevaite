sister in law

This is so completely pathetic. But, alas, it's anonymous, so I'll indulge. I've come to the conclusion that I'm completely in love with my wife's sister. She's younger, smarter, and probably closer to my soul than anyone I've ever met. Nothing about this can ever become public, or be realized. This is a life-sentence... self-imposed as it is. Still... to live with it - well, it's just one of those things that will haunt me for eternity. You live, you love, you learn, and you move on.
