I just hope you read this letter. You know I've tried every other way to tell you how I feel about you except using the phrase, "I love you." I'm doing this to avoid you being embarrassed. I can say I'm not 100% sure you feel the same way as I do now. Maybe the distance between us now is making things more difficult. I do believe, my love, that if by coincidence you read this mail, you know I am saying this to you: I love you and always will. I can't help but tell you this.
