Thanks for the smile you gave me. I really melted inside. I could say nothing, but just stared at your natural beauty. I wish we could go out together some day, and that we could have our nights by the beach. I would pour my feelings out to you then. Thank you for the feelings you awaken. No matter what happens, you are in my heart. I hope I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. That's all I need from you. I love you--that's my promise.
