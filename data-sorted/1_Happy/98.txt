I understand how difficult it has been to work under the tighter budget introduced last year. As I am sure you understand, this is an attempt to streamline our operations by adopting more efficient methods of training and production. You may not know, however, that our production levels increased by nearly twenty percent in the last quarter. This increase is due to the hard work of employees like you who aren't afraid to innovate and finesse solutions to problems rather than throw money at them. At this rate the original budget will come back on track in no time, with revenues up as much as fifty percent. Keep up the good work!
