It feels so lucky to finally be able to love you like I have been wanting to for so long. Your sweet lips leave me speechless with each tender kiss. What have I done to deserve this? And that is another thing I was thinking. It is a little too strange, I think, that we are so right for each other. Some might want to argue about it, but I have a few examples to offer those poor, misguided souls. Your smile is like a world-famous painting. When we kiss, it is like two lost puzzle pieces finally found after a long search that make the picture complete. When we hold each other, time seems to stand still. When I look into your eyes, I see the love in your heart. All of this tells me one thing--our love is true and real.
