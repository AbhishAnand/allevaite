I'm sure it was very disappointing to lose the Doe account after all your hard work. However, I want you to know I have never seen a more polished first-time presentation by a new employee. Given your skills, I am confident that you will have many more opportunities to make sales presentations for the company, and that many of them will result in new accounts. Take care!
