Can't stop thinking about her
There's a girl I talk to, I cant stop thinking about her. I think about her all day and dream about her most nights. When I think about her I get an adrenaline rush, so I have a constant adrenaline rush all day. The other day I was talking to her and this put me in such a good mood I was happy all day. I think she likes me sometimes when I look up in class she's staring at me, she wants to hang around with me alot. I want nothing more than to be with her. I've liked girls before but nothing like this. Am I in love? What should I do?"
