My love for you grows each and every day. I am totally addicted to you, and you are the only drug that keeps me functioning now. When I look into your eyes, I see the real me, a person that lives for a goal and a purpose now. I pray fervently each day that you and I can be in a relationship that will grow to be more than friends some day. For now, I've written this letter to declare my love for you and to tell you that I am here waiting for you now.
