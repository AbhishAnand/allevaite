I realize that some problems have cropped up in the department since you took over as supervisor. As you know, the employees were particularly loyal to John Doe, and we expected some resistance to his replacement. But take heart. I have seen your calm, steady influence in the department and have no doubt that the employees will learn to work well with you. Keep up the good work. We're behind you all the way.
