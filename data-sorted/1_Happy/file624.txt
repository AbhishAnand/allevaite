Last week I

Last week I got shafted. I called up this girl I liked (who apparently seemed somewhat interested) and asked her to have dinner with me during the week. I call her the nite before to confirm and she seemed excited. So the following evening, I call to pick her up. She answers and says "oh, im sorry. I forgot...I already ate. But, we should hang out another time." What The Heck? Then I see her the next week while i'm working and she's acting super nice like nothing happened (she must think she did nothing wrong). What a chicken-head.
