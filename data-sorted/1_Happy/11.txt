My heart is hungry for your love, but my mind is aware of what it cannot have. I know we belong to different worlds, so then why did you come and change everything in my life? I thought I didn't want to love again. I thought I wouldn't be able to because my heart has been hurt so much. To even say, "I do"--it's a scary thought, but you came along, and I suddenly became fearless.
