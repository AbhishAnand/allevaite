Fantasy

I often fantasize that I'm a part of Star Trek Voyager. It started out as something to distract my mind before falling asleep, but now it's the setting for all types of fantasies: romance, acts of heroism, and just plain pretending to be someone I'm not. I've even begun thinking of myself as a Starfleet officer: confident, brave, honest, hard-working, intelligent, creative--all of the things I feel I'm not.
