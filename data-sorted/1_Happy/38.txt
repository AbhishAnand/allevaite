The world has many beauties: some are lilies, jasmines, irises, roses; some were just simple, plain flowers; none of them attracts me. It was your innocent smile, your sparkling eyes. It was like lightening had struck me, it was like an angel had appeared to me. It was you and your love that made me what I am today.
