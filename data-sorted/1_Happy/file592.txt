I love them

i keep meeting and falling for men i cant have. it is completely innocent- for example a chance meeting when i was staying at my sisters boyfriends house, i met his bandmate, and we ended up chatting till after 7am the next day. we enjoyed each others company so much, and we kissed before we left each other. But of course now i am 300 miles away again, and cant stop thinking about him. a few months earlier, a similar thing happening meeting a boy at a folk music festival, we spent the weekend together, but the only thing we have now is each others mobile numbers. we also like 400 miles apart. i cannto find this with anyone i know or lives near me. i just keep getting hurt over and over again. whats wrong with me.
