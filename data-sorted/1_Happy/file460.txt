Birthday Cake

I baked a birthday cake for a friend. I mixed the cake batter in a green plastic bowl. As I mixed, I noticed that bits of green plastic from the bowl were flecked in the batter. Rather than make a new cake, I added multi-colored sprinkles to hide the plastic. Everyone loved the cake.
