Hey! I've noticed that you've been flirting with me lately. At least it seems that way. You make it obvious that you really like me. I know I really like you. I want to know if you like me as much as I do you. If you do, please tell me so. I wish that you would be mine and that I could be yours. If you think this is love, please tell me. I want you to be mine.
