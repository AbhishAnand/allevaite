You are my "knight in shinning armor." I wouldn't be where I am today, if it weren't for you reaching out and helping me. I will never forget you or the things you have done for me. You are the "best" in my eyes and in my heart. I love every moment we've spent and the small talks we've shared. I do hope that one day our friendship will grow into love. No matter whatever becomes of "us," I will always hold you in my heart.
