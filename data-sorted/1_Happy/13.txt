I wish I could read your beautiful mind and see if you really love me. I know I love you with all my heart, but I have no idea if you feel the same way. My heart is ready to split in two because I need you, and yet I don't know if you need me. Please, from the bottom of my heart, I confess my everlasting love to you and hope that you feel the same way. Please give me an answer.
