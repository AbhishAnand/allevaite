My beautiful love, you are my sunrise and sunset. You are my world and you have been since the first time I saw you from afar. My heart leaped in my chest and the vision of you made me catch my breath. Your hair was lightly blowing in the breeze, and the sun was bouncing off your face, making your eyes sparkle like stars in the midnight sky. I felt love the first time I looked at you, and my world became a beautiful place to live in. I often ask myself, what in the world would I do without you now? I hope to never find out the answer to that question.
