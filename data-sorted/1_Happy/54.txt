That night our paths crossed was as if a magnetic force joined us together. It seemed as if I forgot to wake up that morning and face true reality. As our eyes connected, it seemed too fresh and real to be a dream. The fire, the strength, the longing to be loved--words were not needed as the world closed in and our eyes connected our two souls together.
