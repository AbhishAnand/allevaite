You are the only one who can make me happy with your love and affection. Since I met you, I have noticed that life is worth living. I live mine just for you. You have stolen my heart from me. Alone I am lost. Please, do not let the distance between us become larger. Each day is more wonderful than the previous one, if I spend it with you. The closer you get to me, it seems the more I love you. A heart truly in love never loses hope but always believes in the promise of love, no matter how long the time and how far the distance. There are so many ways I want to tell you that I really love you. My feelings for you are true and pure, like your kind heart. I have tried many times to confess this to you, but you always turn a deaf ear to what I say. Remember one thing--I love you and will always love you.
