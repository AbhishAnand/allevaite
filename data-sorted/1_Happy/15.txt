Every night when I close my eyes, thoughts of you fill me with joy. Every morning when I open my eyes, you're the first thought on my mind. I am certain that I am in love with you. I want to hold you, kiss you and to feel your body near me. If you'll be mine, you'll make me the happiest woman in the world. If you turn me away, I don't know if I can take it. But either way, you'll always be the greatest love I've ever had.
