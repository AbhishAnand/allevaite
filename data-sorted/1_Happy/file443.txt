Fat Kid

Sometimes, I wish I'd been "the fat kid" when I was younger. I used to be pretty shy, and I'm still really insecure and self-concious, so I might as well have been the guy who could sit on people when he got mad at them :P Also, it seems like all the kids who were like that when they were younger are better at working out nowadays, so... Anyway, as weird as it might be, I'm actually trying to gain weight now, muscle and fat, so, yeah :P
