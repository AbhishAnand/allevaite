We have been friends for a long time now. Every day spent with you is like a wonderland of surprises. I've stood back, watched and listened as you told me of your past loves. If you only knew that there is a true love waiting for you--patiently. A hug from you makes me feel brand new. But these are words I'll never say, and so I will just sit back, patiently waiting; loving you in silence.
