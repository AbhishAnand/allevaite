I'm thinking of

I'm thinking of taking a break from school and moving 2 hours away for a boy. I know that if I move there we'll hook up 'cuz the only thing that's stopping us from being together is the distance. I like him a whole lot and we really do connect on certain levels, but I also know that he's not THE ONE, and I can't see us being together in the long run. But I just kind of want to have fun for now, not worry about school for awhile, and be a crazy 20 year old while I still can.
