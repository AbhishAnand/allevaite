I'm in love

I'm in love with my best friend, who is also my neighbor??? It's a double edged sword...If I'm close to him, I feel the pain of him not loving me like that, and if I lose him, I feel lost??? I am a very optimistic person, but in this case I just wonder...Why did I even meet him? I'm being distant till I can figure something out???
