It has not been long since we met, but everything has changed in my life. I experience more excitement and feel like the happiest man on the earth. I also think about you all the time. It is not just at bedtime, or upon waking up, but at my work, when I drive, and at all times. Sometimes I sit and, without any reason, call your name out loud, until I realize that you are far away, and then I just smile at the sweet thought of you.
