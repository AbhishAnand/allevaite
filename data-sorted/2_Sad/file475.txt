i want to die because i can't live without him

i'm only 18 years old and i found my soul mate... we were perfect... for so long... then he moved away to school and now we are so broken... he sees nothing wrong with anything but he's killing me softly my heart is so broken and i cant take it anymore... i cant take anything anymore... im so sorry...
