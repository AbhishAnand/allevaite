I lie

I constantly lie to be to gain acceptance and seem "cool". I lie about girls and about how much money I have. I pretend to know all sorts of things but in reality I'm pretty ignorant. I keep lying to myself, saying I'm going to quit smoking and quit drinking, just quit all those harmful things all together and the next time its around me I smoke and drink as much as I can for fear of it really being the last time I do it. I'm a sad person. I'm a complete jerk to a lot of people that have it coming but inside I don't even feel like they deserve but I do it to make other people laugh at anothers expense. I want to be a better person and it's going to start today. I'm going to quit drinking and smoking, I'm going to stop lying about insignifigant stuff, I'm going to treat people well no matter how they act and if I dont feel thats possible I will keep my mouth shut.
