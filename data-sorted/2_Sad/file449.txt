Somebody lost his job...

I did something in the past out of just mere curiosity and maybe for my stupid reasons and actually ended up having this person lose his job. I don't have the courage to go and seak his forgivness and I think I don't deserve it either. He did not do any harm to me nor did he hurt me in anyway, when I realised my stupidity it was too late. I chickened out for the first time in my life and was scared to comeout in open. I 've lived with this for almost about 8 years now but the burden is too much to bear. I seak his forgiveness. I hope he would and would have moved on in life. I hope he gets all that he had then and now dreams of in his life... Please forgive me I didn't realise my action would cost you your job.
