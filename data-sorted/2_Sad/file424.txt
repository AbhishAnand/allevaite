Lazy

My husband and I have been together for 4 yrs. we even have a little girl! He has to always sit there doing nothing and telling me that I need to do something for him. We ended up starving before he would really look for a job...I work 10 hrs days...go home cook for him and take care of our child....I'm not asking for sympathy but some damn help! Sometimes I just want him to get up and be a man.
