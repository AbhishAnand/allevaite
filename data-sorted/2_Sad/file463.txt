Where did I go wrong

I am currently in a relationship for almost seven years and I dont love him, in part because I found out things that Im not happy about but stay because I told him I forgive him and feel almost obligated. Then two years ago I saw my ex-boyfriend at a club (he did not see me) but it just brought back all these feelings that I have for him (I broke up with him, due to father-trust issues) Last year though I learned he got engaged and married. I've just become so depressed, since then because it should have been me. I've thought about him since that day I saw him and continue to. Every other day I pull out his letters he wrote me while in college and look at his pic.
