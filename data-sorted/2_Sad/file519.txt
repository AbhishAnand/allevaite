From twelve to fifteen

I fell in love for the first time when I was twelve years old. Seems strange, right? I always believed in the philosophy that you can fall in love at any age. We were in gym together, he was fourteen but in eighth grade. I liked him and he thought I did, but we never talked about it. I am in band, and for the eighth grade graduation we had to play for the graduates. That graduation night, I realized there was someone that I loved more than him, someone that made me feel amazing inside and that I would do anything to be with. His brother. We had fun together that year; we were the 'little brother and sister' of the gym group and talked a lot. I think he even liked me at a point. For eighth grade I wasn't able to keep in contact with either of them. Freshman year, they were sophomores, I managed to talk to them more, and the younger brother knew that I liked him. We got closer from our talks every day. Come sophomore year, I decided to get off my lazy butt and ask him how he felt about me. Five minutes before I was going to walk up to him, my friend told me that he asked the year before and that he didn't like me that way. Of course, I was upset. I had fallen in love with his brother before, but this was a different kind of love. More genuine. I'm currently working on getting over him, but I still find myself craving the exact words he said, what he looked like when he said it, and so much more. It's things like these that make you feel like you're not good enough. But there was always the possibility that my friend was lying, because a friend of his likes me and he's been trying to set me up with him. It's really hard on me and I don't like to talk about it.
