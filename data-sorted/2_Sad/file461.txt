my life

I'm sitting in front of this computer telling you my life story. You have no idea who I am but you are probably bored and have nothing else better to do than waste time reading about other peoples confessions. At this point in my life I can't help but feel my entire life has been wasted. I have done nothing with my life and am no closer to reaching "my goals" in life than I was 5 years ago. I'm actually probably in worse shape. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and have no friends and have hurt the one person who I loved and actually cared for me. I've made her cry and ignored her for what reasons? I have no idea. My social skills are very poor and I can't help trying to avoid people because I feel they don't like me even though I've never met them or meet them a few times. I spend most of time just on the computer and sleeping. My family knows almost nothing about me. I really never communicate with them. Looking back in my life I never had a real good relationship with anyone. I never trusted anyone really. I wish I could just start my life over because it seems this one isn't going anywhere and ill just end up killing myself sooner or later because I don't have anything. My mom and dad have seen me make mistake after mistake and yet this still don't judge me and support me. I wish I could make them happy.... If I only accomplish one thing in my life at this point on I wish I could make my parents proud. But at this point i don't know if I could do that or how I could do that. Their unconditional love amazes me and is the only thing I care about and the only thing I have.
