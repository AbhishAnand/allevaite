I miss her

I had my chance with a girl I clearly didn't deserve, and I threw it away because I'm too bloody arrogant. She's wanted me, off and on, since we were fourteen. I pretended not to be interested (I don't know, because I'm a jerk?), and we barely talked until August of last year. Since then, we got pretty close, and eventually, after a lot of alcohol, we kissed at a Christmas dance. We spent New Year together, went to see a movie and hung out a bit, and I never asked her to be my girlfriend. She went to Paris for a week, and whatever happened there (or perhaps my lack of willingness to commit - again because I'm a dumb jerk) put her off me. She's perfect, and I knew it would never last (there's no way a girl like her could date down forever, but I thought I would have a good enough run, before I had to off and take my turn at sowing my wild oats - I'm only seventeen after all) but it's no less painful. When I got that "we should just be friends" text (and yes it was a text - Fitzgerald would not approve. Ironically enough she was a fan of The Great Gatsby, and wrote an essay on the theme of technology creating distance between people that won a nationwide prize...) I almost cried, in public no less. Usually when I break up with a girl, I focus on what's wrong with her. I can't find anything of substance in this case - my only problems with her stemmed from my (well hidden) jealousy of her intelligence (six months younger than me and already with an offer to the best medical school in the country - something I still lack and not for want of trying), and that she didn't like me talking about other girls (before we were going out, I hasten to add). OK, I really needed to get that off my chest.
