Which of course brings this story to the "why?" factor. Why might this be? I am not unattractive; I'm 5'1, petite, not overweight, and I have been told I'm very attractive (not by males though). I frequently have crushes on guys I know, celebrities, and even random strangers I find attractive. I have a huge amount of lust simmering within that inevitably leads to immense frustration with this matter.
