I don't think

I don't think college is for me. All my senses, all my reasonings tell me to go through the motions, do what I need to do to graduate, go to grad school, get a respectable job, make alot of money and support the family I don't even have yet. I suppose deep down somewhere a part of me wants this too, wants to lead the normal life.

I'm enlisting in the Marine Crops. I feel the call in my heart and in my soul and I know that I don't want to live someone else's life. I'm still going to try to stay in college, but what happens will happen. I hope my girlfriend loves me enough to understand for I love her more than breath.

I'm sorry mom and dad. I will make you proud in a different way.
