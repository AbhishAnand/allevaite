self pity

I am utterly full of self loathing. I wish I weren't so needy and emotional, but I'm so dependent on others, yet I'm a triangle peg being jammed into the star box of everyone's expectations. Now that I'm sick people try to help them but my different drummer self is driving them up the wall. I don't have any idea what I've done wrong many times, and when I do know what I've done to irritate them I can't be able to seem to fix it. It sucks. I hate myself for being a burden. I hate myself for being sick. I hate myself for dissapointing loved ones. And when I try to conform just to not dissapoint people who are trying to help me, I hate the fakeness that I am, an utterly empty shell. ITs not my. I'm watching in disgust from the sidelines. I wish I had worth in my life. The only worth I feel is that I've never abandoned my children no matter how sick I feel and I'm not leaving them motherless even if I am a semi-bad mother. For all the mistakes I make, I hope one day at least they know they have a mother who cared enough to try.
