me

I hate myself for loving you. No matter how many times i try not to, i always end up looking for you in a crowd. The last time i truly felt happy was with you, and that still hasn't changed. I've realized the more i want something the less chance i have of getting it, but still i want to be able to with you everyday. I'm sorry
