Friends mother.

Many years back one day in my drunken state made an abusive call to my friends mother. I pretend to not acknowledge it but, from within I know what I did was wrong, and she knows it was me. It has hurt me all this while and I know it would keep hurting me for the rest of my life, I 've lost a friend in doing so and every time I run into her I feel miserable and scared that she might just catch me and ask me why I did what I did. Don't know why but, sure 'm shamed of this act of mine and hate myself everyday more for the same reason...
