DEEP FEAR of being ALONE

I am just so scared deep down in my soul that i will never find someone to love me. i am scared, more than anything else in the world, that i will die alone, without that special someone in my life. I feel like there is noone i can talk to about this, and i feel like noone would ever believe that i feel like this. I just feel so alone, even when i'm around people. I just need that special connection with the man of my dreams. Oh how i long to find him.
