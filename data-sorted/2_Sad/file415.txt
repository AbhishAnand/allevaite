You're Fired

I have been with a guy for one year. He meets this chick at work that he has knowns for three months and says he wants to marry her. Needless to say, I'm pissed. She works in Personnel, so I sent an anonymous email to their inter office ethics hotline and ratted on her. Saying that she has been compromising her HR status and divulging information to him. He told me that she is probably going to lose her job and is going to have to move 100 miles away to find another one, considering it's a rural area.
