I shot my sister

Four years ago (as annually) me and my family went out hunting in the woods. In one session i fired a single round from a safari 550 into a bush (which i assumed was a deer as my family was hunting in a different section). It just so happened that my sister cassy was trying to make me jump for a prank....The hospital says that i had shot her clean through her diaphragm, she cant talk now. At the time i couldnt live with my self, but now i have came to accept that my future isnt in my hands.
