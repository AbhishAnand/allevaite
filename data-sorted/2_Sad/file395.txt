Lost..

Sometimes I just want to dissapear into a hole. The life I've created is too fast paced, and very high maintenance. I've always had a complex about trying to impress people to win their friendship, love or approval... I know its silly but something in me as programmed what way. Probbaly came from and angry father figure. I always feel like I'm not good enough. I know I have people who look up to me now and that's even more pressure. I don't want to let them down and theres ALWAYS an expectation to make bigger and more exciting things happen. I want out of this rat race. I've thought of my ideal life, but it would mean compromising my morals... What is worth more - Dreams that Come True or Security, Relationships and Responsibility. I'm scared I'll die with regrets!
