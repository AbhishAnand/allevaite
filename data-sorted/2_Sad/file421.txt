Stupid Heart!

Ok, so I'm only fourteen, but that doesn't mean I can't fall in love, but my stupid heart decides to fall for one of the hundreds of guys I can never have and at a time when I barely believe my heart's there! STUPID HEART WHY CAN'T YOU STOP THE B-BMP TILL I'M HAPPY AGAIN?! See, I'm having trouble getting over some things that happened in my past, so I decided that I wouldn't fall in love till I could cry again as I believe being able to cry at the sad times is a sign that you're usually truely and honestly happy, well I haven't really cried in about about a year, so I don't think I'm very happy, but my stupid heart had to decide "Hey, check it out, here's a guy I've none literally my whole life, he's three years older than me, there's not a girl not after him, and he's kinda nice, hmm... I know let's get even more confused and fall in love!" STUPID, STUPID HEART!!!!!!!!!!
