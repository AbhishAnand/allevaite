only me

i know that im only 14 and people will say it doesnt matter, and people mature at different rates. but in my school and life i have never had a boyfriend-i doubt anyone has ever liked me at all. i dont know whats wrong with me:im in good shape, and i know i am pretty, im not being vain. i am a little shy but i still have no problem talking to anyone, boys included- so i dont know what to do, i feel so lonely and stupid
