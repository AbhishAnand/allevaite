1 month

I remember when I held you close. When time stopped still forever because I took in so much detail about our moment. It became a memory that will last forever in my mind, but when we left each other that memory was no longer enough. For one month, I was hurt by the silence between us. We rarely spoke a full conversation, and it seems, that you might have someone else on your mind. I've lived a life without being human. Then you came and made me feel everything that human beings feel, and it now torments me. I wish I told you what I wanted to say. It's obvious, painful, and right now, true. I want to say good bye, but that would be impossible.
