i need you to know this

I love you so much. I've done alot of bad things the last couple of months, but i want to make everything better.. i havent exactly told you about everything that i've done because im afraid you will leave me if you find out.. Every single day it eats me up inside knowing that you dont know, i sometimes think that your better off without me, and at times it's probably true.. your the most beautiful girl i've ever met, inside and out.. and i honestly love you with all my heart..
