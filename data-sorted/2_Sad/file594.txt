Tonight

When I walked back up my driveway this evening and you drove away in your car, I was crying. You have neglected this friendship for the last time and unfortunately, this is goodbye. I will not be calling you back before I move. I will not be calling you back when I settle in. Best of luck in the upcoming year, you will probably be needing it.
