horrible daughter

I am a 28 your old who just found out from her mom's boyfriend that she was in the E.R. for severe vertigo. Your thinking so what right. Well let me say this. I have lived in another state from my mom for 6 years. In the six years my mom has been through emotional crap and family drama than we had when i lived there. We have a had 2 sudden and unexpected deathers in our family. My mom and grandfather were deeply upset about these. And in some depression and guilt and need me, the support of me. We are all we have. Where was I , here thousands of miles away, across the country. I am never home when she needs me . Yes, I fly home when the happens but it is not the same. I can only stay for a while and then need to come back to my family. I feel like I should be there, move back home . She needs me, but then I always talk myself out of it. She has been there for me always. Through it all. I mean some crazy stuff, I have put my mom through hell. And here I set. Just go off the phone and all I can say is Thanks for letting me know. I can't do anything for her, can't stop by, can't be there for her like she is always there for me. I feel horrible. At that moment when I picked up the phone, I see it is her number and it's not her calling, and you hear I have something I need to tell you. My heart stopped. I thought oh my god this is it. Something has happend to my one and only parent. What am I going to do. It was not as bad as my gut reaction but still . Am i the worst daughter? At this moment I would say yes.
