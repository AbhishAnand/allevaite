Lost love that could have been

I'm in love with a girl 700km away, who recently broke up in her relationship and was in love with me for a little while. I'm in a relationship with a girl already, but am never sure if she is the one, not like the girl I found. Now she has found someone else that I am friends with and it has crushed me inside that it could have been me. Not knowing for sure hurts me even more, because I still think about her all the time, and how much I guess I shouldn't love her. Life will go on, but i'll always try to remember what I could have had with MM.
