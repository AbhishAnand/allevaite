I don't think the guy my friend likes would make a good couple

So there's this guy that my friend likes. But I don't really think they make a good couple because I think me and the guy she likes are soulmates. We have so much in common. I'm afraid to tell her this because she'll probably get mad and say that I am "stealing" the guy she likes and im gonna ask him out or something. I'm not really attracted to him but if he did ask me out I think I'd say yes. We're like totally soulmates!! Thanks for listening.
