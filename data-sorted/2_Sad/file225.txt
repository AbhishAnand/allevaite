Depression

I've quite obviously suffered from depression most of my life. Though I never seeked any sort of treatment, mostly because I was worried it'd be too expensive for my parents. Now here I am, recently unemployed. No friends. The man I'm in love with lives across the country. I'm distant from my parents. My sister never calls. I cry every night. The problem is, I don't know what to do to get out of this. I sit in my room on the internet and sleep absurd hours. I'm always tired. I feel weak. It hurts to pretend I'm okay. How do you break this cycle? I just don't know how to fix myself when the problem is myself. I'm so tired of living on pause. Wanting so much, but being unable to motivate myself. I'm tired of seeing other people with the things I want, doing the things I want to do. I'm a wreck.
