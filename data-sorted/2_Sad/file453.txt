Keeping things to myself

You know, when you know someone likes you...you start to think that they're not bad and then bam! after a while all you can think about is whether he's checking out your butt when you're bending or whether he's smelling your hair when your back is facing him. Well, there's this guy (who used to be prettyyy fat but then went on an excessive weight loss drive and lost a lot but he still isn't exactly attractive.) call him M. He started liking me in 2005 when we just talked generally and he didn't have many friends. Then we became sort of good friends the next year when we had a lot of classes together and he told me about the people he liked. I didn't EVER think about him. Not once in a mushy way. And then at the end of 2006 he started flirting with me. Of course, I was confused and just ignored him. (Just FYI- I'm not exactly thin and pretty in a way that hits your face. I'm 5 or 7 kilos overweight and I wear spectacles. ) So yeah. Then in the middle of last year he got really close to me. I was also sort of falling for him pretending I wasn't. Now I don't know why he won't just get it out and over with so I'm always waiting for him to make it obvious, when I know that's not the point. What should I do? Continue ignoring him and his subtle (REALLY subtle) moves or declare that I like him. I'm scared that if I do...I might just not like him.
