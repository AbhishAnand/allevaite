Thanks alot

You make the plans okay? Every single time I try to please everyone, I get shoved back in the corner with other plans. Why can't you people just listen to me for once and do what I feel like doing. It is always about your plans.. that him and I always have to follow. Just listen to me for once, please. Don't make things harder. I am stressed because of it. I do not have a say in anything I get to do, which is pretty pathetic. Thank you for taking my voice.
