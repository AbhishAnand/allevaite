I hate myself

I'm a fat, cheesy parody of masculinity. I have a stupid, sparse mustache, and these ridiculous gold chains that I tell everyone are religious medals, because I'm oh-so-proud of my heritage, but I'm no man. It's all props, and misdirection. There was this one beautiful kid who worked in the office next to mine, and I made all kinds of snotty remarks about him, but I was just ashamed of how he made me feel. I'm a disgusting child, a fraud. I wish I had the courage to be honest to my cronies, at the office.
