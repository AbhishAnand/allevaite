I miss you. I miss the way you used to kiss me. I miss how it was okay to do everything we used to do. I miss being able to talk to you. I miss sleeping in your bed. I miss how you made me feel when you'd touch me, even if it was just holding hands. I miss your hugs. I miss feeling comfortable in life. When ever I think about you I feel like you died or something because I can't express my feelings for you. It seriously makes me ache.
