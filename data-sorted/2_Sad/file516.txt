Screwed For Life ...

I have had a ruff childhood and now i am in my teens. I can't seem to ever get more than a couple hours of sleep a night because I wake up from night mare constently of my past. I think everything i have been through has screwed me for life. I can't keep a relationship and I only trust one person in this world. Do you know any ways to get HORRIBLE, i mean HORRIBLE memroies out of your head so you can get close enough to give your best friend a hug? I can't even do that... i hate it but i am so scared of getting hurt again ...
