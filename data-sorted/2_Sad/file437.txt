We really don't love each other

I don't really love him -- I think I'm with him because he's the only one who will ever put up with me. Sad part is, I know the only reason he does so is because he is too afraid to leave because his self-confidence is so low. If he even had a bit more self confidence, he would never be with me, because he really doesn't love me either. We're together because we're afraid to be alone, not because we love each other.
