this boy.. completely different.. and.. i know i don't feel the same about him now as i used to, but when he told me one night- drunk off whiskey shots- that he really really likes me.. and has for months... and.. i count back..to every last time i saw him- and we always end up mildly physical (cuddling, etc) and i wonder why.. even though my now boyfriend.. was always there.. and always got upset with me (considering he's been broken from cheating more times than once)... that i let any of this happen am i starving for attention?
