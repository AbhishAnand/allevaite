Fooling ones self

I have been doing business since a long time and earning pretty well, but lately there has been a slump in my work, i havent got any new business since i am addicted to the internet and thats what i do everyday, i come to the office only to find myself surfing the internet and this continues for hours, when i go back home i feel very guilty since i have a family to support that includes my wife my mother and two daughters. I want to get out of this syndrome and start doing stuff to earn, but looks like i am in a trap, just sitting there in the office doing nothing .... God help me please.
