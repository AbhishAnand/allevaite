Skinny, Hungry.

I have been so broke lately and scared to ask my parents for money because they just gave me 200$ which I immediately spent so I could go to a music festival and out drinking. SO I've basically been starving myself, like all I had to eat today was half a packet of stale banana chips and 20 Parliament Light cigarettes (would rather smoke than eat, if forced to choose). The good news is, I've managed to starve myself down to a size 00!! I just measured my waist and it is 23 inches!! The bad news is that it actually looks terrible :( I hope my student loan check arrives soon.
