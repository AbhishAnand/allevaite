She left me

I met a girl 6 months ago. I fell in love with her. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was missing work and getting depressed from thinking about her so much. I was the happiest I had ever been when she asked me out. Since then, I got texts saying she was never ever going to leave me, that she loved me more then anyone shed ever loved before, that she wanted to have me forever. Then she left me for someone else.
