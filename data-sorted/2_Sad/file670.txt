ear piercing

so i've wanted to pierce the top of my ear for the LONGEST time, just because it would look great and well, sometimes you just want to do something. so i got home last night and decided to just do it. i grabbed an earring, cleaned it off and tried to make it go, but it wouldn't. so then i got a needle and just wiped it off and pierced my ear. i showed it off all day but i was afraid it would get infected. now, it is. i have no idea what to do, so i took out the earring, only to look it up and it says not to take it out. but i can't get it back in-it hurts too much. so now im basically wiping my ear with rubbing alcohol and i took an ibuprofen cuz i have no clue what to do and im hoping that against the odds it will just go away. my parents don't know about it and they would be so angry and dissapointed in me if they did. IM SO SCARED!!! what if the infection spreads of something- i dont know what i will do and in regret piercing my ear so much. i feel so guilty and afraid and totally alone.
