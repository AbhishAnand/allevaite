Please someone help!

Its hard as heck to make good grades and impress people with my school capabilities.. im logiclly smart but i get distracted very very very easily i didn't do homework... i know i can do it but i dont . i have adhd i think. I have a great life great freinds but the things that i need like grades just dont tend to like me. i try so hard to be a teachers pet but...i disrupt class too much 4 them to like me. The teachers grade on if you did your work and not so much on if you actually know it... I just wanna leave that school but my mom says my grades arent good enouph. My gpa usually ranges from 1.5 to 2.2. I can easily make cs and up but in one class its damn near impossible 4 me... Im going to summerschool 4 sure but its hard. and i am already lazy.
