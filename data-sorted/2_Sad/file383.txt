Is love that hard to find?

I am 27 yrs old and unfortunately for me I never had a boyfriend in my life. I am pressured by time, my family and friends and I don't know what to say to them. I really hope and pray that God has plans for me and I hope i'm not destined to die without experiencing romantic love. I have been in love a few times but the love is never reciprocated. I have fallen in love with a co-worker and I felt he somehow has feelings for me too. He teases me alot, I sometimes caught him looking at me through a tiny window at the office. He always make sure we had breakfast at the same time. but it never developed into something until I left the company. I really doubted myself if my assumption was right about him having feelings for me. He never pursued me and I came to believe that everything has no meaning at all, the stares, the touches, the laughs...I felt I was never worthy of him, I can't measure up to his standards and this made me afraid of not having to be loved or find love again..in my heart I still hope for love and I hope it won't be too late for me...
