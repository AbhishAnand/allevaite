They say marriage is hard work . . . .

I think this is a lie people in bad marriages tell themselves to feel better about marrying the wrong person. My marriage is no work at all. School is work. Jobs are work. Family is often work. Marriage is fun. Is everyone else just going along with this myth, or are there really that many bad matches? Or have we accidentally stumbled onto the secret - by waiting to marry until we had enough money to live on, by not having kids? Or is he really doing all the work for over a decade, and I am just taking advantage?
