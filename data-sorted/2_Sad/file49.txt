I feel so unfaithful to my online boyfriend though, and it feels like I love both, but that I might have more chance with this guy in my class. Even though, I don't ever talk to him. No matter how many times I try to break up with my boyfriend, he finds sweet things to bring me back. It's sad, and extremely frustrating. My friends tell me I should just never go online again. But I can't. I'm too attached, too dependant, and I hate myself for it.
