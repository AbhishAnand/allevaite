my girlfriend thinks

my girlfriend thinks im in love with her.. but the more time that passes... the more i grow apart from her and realize that she is not the one for me.. i know she loves me and that is why it is so hard for me to break her heart and tell her how i feel...
im scared to lose a friend and hurt someone i care about..
