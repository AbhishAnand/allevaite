But I've had a crush on the guy ever since I met him, too. Except I made a move. She doesn't know that me and this guy had one amazing night together, and I never told anybody. We decided that we wouldn't continue it, but I didn't tell him why I didn't want a relationship with him. I feel so guilty, and I even once told my friend that I had a little crush on him. She got really mad at me, and stopped talking to me for a month, or so, before I told her I was just being silly and that I was joking.
