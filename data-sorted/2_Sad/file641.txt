I'm lying to

I'm lying to the world. I walk around with this disguise i put on my face. The world see's me cheerful, happy, always laughing but inside i'm slowly decaying. My imperfection's are causing my selfesteem to descend. I feel as if i will never understand love or know the true meaning of friendship. I barricade myself away from everyone and anyone. Slowly becoming a hermitt. This wall used as a defense mechanism i have built over the years has grown exponentially. I stand here emotionless due to the many years of putting off every emotion into a storage inside my mind until finally it's exploding. Tear's sees to exist. Love is an illusion to me. While growing up, love was never in my life. Never feeling love from my family nor friends. My father come's across to me as a stranger. Never been the father figure i needed. I hate him for that. Lack of love has affected the way i perceive life. Relationship's never evolve. Im afraid to love. Afraid to be hurt. Any type of relationship ive been in, end's shortly after it begin's. Never allowing anyone to penetrate the great wall that i've built. Im afraid that wall has grown to such a sized that no one can ever penetrate. So today, i confess.... im depressed....
