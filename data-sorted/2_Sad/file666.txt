Let Me In

"What's Wrong?" I asked. I wish that I would have know what I just got myself into. That horrible feeling creeps in my stomach. The fact that he questioned the status of our relationship, I wish I would have kept my mouth shut. All I did was ask what was wrong. I'll never understand quite exactly the extent of the demons that reside in his mind. It seems like I will never be able to help him. I'm not good enough. Possibly, it may be the fact that he treats me like I am not even in this relationship. He hurts me when he does not let me in. I wanted to just help him...that's all. I will always love him despite everything..........
