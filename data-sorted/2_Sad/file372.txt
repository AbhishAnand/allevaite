Gossip girl

I am sorry I said that she was the worst clarinet player; I'm especially sorry I said it to YOU. As soon as I said it, I knew that you would just run right up to her as soon as you could to tell her what I said. She's nasty enough as it is, now she'll be even worse. What you DON'T know is that I heard she said that you were the worst player, and that she was better than you, and should have your spot. Some friend, huh? I suppose we all need to grow up. This is more like middle school than college. I'm sorry I said it, she's probably a nice person when she's not so insecure. But I'm still mad that you went and told her.
