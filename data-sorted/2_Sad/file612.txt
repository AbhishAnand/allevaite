i've been really

i've been really depressed for a long time. I'm really unhappy about my life right now. I miss my friends who somehow drifted apart. I'm always stressed out about school. I'm stressed out about my parents and their financial issues. I just want to be able to take charge and fix things for myself so badly but I just cant do this alone. Things have fallen apart, and I don't know how i'm supposed to move on.
