Eating The Forbidden

I just found out today that this lasagna i have been eating and purchasing for over a year has pork in it now that is big deal for me as a muslim who has never had pork before except one time before my mistake but i spit it out, now im okey im over it and not buying that brand again but i have a friend who also happens to be muslim and has some really messed up things to say which could border on being a muslim fanatic even though he doesn't pray, the funny thing is that i FED HIM THAT PORK INFESTED LASAGNIA TWICE !! and ofcourrrrrrrrse he will never know
