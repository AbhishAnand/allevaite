Math Teacher.

I feel in love with my math teacher throughout 7th and 8th grade. He was about 30 years older than me, and married with kids. His daughter was older than I was. Thinking back on it creeps MYSELF out sometimes. And I would reach the little cards on the "Dirty Little Secret" music video to convince myself that their 'dirty little secrets' were worse than the one I had. Oh dear.
