Life
I don't know what im going to do with my life; im afraid of failure and disappointing people; everyone seems to peg me for the type of person who's going to make something of themself but in all honestly i dont think i will; i dont know who i am or have any idea of what i want in life; im going nowhere fast and if this makes sense - i care so much that im beginning to not care.
