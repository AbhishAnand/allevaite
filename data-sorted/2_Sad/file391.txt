I miss you

I was in love for the first and only time in my life when I was 13 years old. And I was in love with my best friend. And he was a blue eyed god.. and i regret so much never telling him how much i cared. when i found out we were moving away i almost killed myself, it was so painful to know i wouldn't see him everyday. and now it's been 6 years since I've seen him. The last time I saw him was at our farewell dinner and he gave me a hug and kiss on the cheek. And I still remember that. I remember everything, including the time we went to look at gibson les pauls in cherry red at the guitar store. and the first time you came to my house. and the time we were at a movie night and we wrestled on the ground and you stole my pillow and said you wanted to keep it because it reminded me of you. If you're out there, you can still wrestle me to the ground and steal my pillow. I miss you. -H.
