my father

He's lost the term 'dad' to me. I hate him. I've no respect for him anymore, whatsoever. I will never say 'I love you, too' to him, again. I won't believe another lie. I don't care what happens to him. At least, that's what I like to tell myself. He wasn't there for my brother and isn't for me. My brother mentioned it when I was younger, and I thought, "He's crazy--Dad's great." I now realize what my brother said was true. But no matter what, I can't help it. I still call him dad. On the off chance that he calls, I still say 'I love you, too' when we hang up. I still expect to see him when he says he'll be there. I still care. And I hate it. But most of all, I hate myself. I'm a wimp. I can't let go. I'm still 'Daddy's little girl.' It hurts. I still cry whenever he doesn't show up. I still want to punch the wall when he goes home without stopping to say a simple 'hi' to me. I still want to die when he talks to my mom, whom he divorced over 10 God damn years ago, and doesn't bother to ask her to pass the phone to me. I try to ignore him. I did for a while. But I still answer the phone. I don't even think he knows that I possibly fractured my hand the last time I punched something because of him. What the wrong with me?
