love is depressing

I've liked the same girl for the past 3 years. I always do stuff for her but she has no idea i did it. The other day i found out she just got a boyfriend. It's so depressing cause this guy isn't as smart as me, not as nice to her as me, way fatter than me and is ugly. Even her best friend is with me on this one. What is wrong with me, she picked someone like that over me...
