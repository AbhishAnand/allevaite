I Lied

when I told you not to come over cuz I was feeling ill I really went out on a date instead. I would normally feel bad about it but weve been together 4 years and you never take me out plus for the last 2 something years you've been treating me like dirt. Oh and by the way you've treating me sooo badly that sometime when you cry on the phone I have to cover my mouth to keep you from knowing that I'm laughing.
