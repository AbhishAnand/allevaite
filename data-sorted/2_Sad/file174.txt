Why do we bother?

I'm beginning to hate everything. Nature is boring and empty. Eating food is a chore...I wish I could just live off of vitamins and coffee. Music is played out. Nothing is really sacred in this world, it seems. There are only three things left in this world that I get enjoyment from: 1. Romance with my man 2. Skydiving 3. My job (it's an adrenaline job). Everything is else is boring and I can't be bothered. The magic is gone and I live for no good reason that I can think of. Maybe I should go have some kids or something. I have no hope. I'm just here. I don't know what I have to look forward to. I feel like I've done all the living I could possibly want to do. I don't understand people who want to live to be 120 years old. That's just madness. I have to think that such people are either idiots or really skilled escapists because reality is ugly and that's the truth. Maybe I should dope myself up so that I don't have to be conscious of this wretched experience called "living." Barf. I can't sleep.
