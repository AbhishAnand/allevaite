two girls

i think im in love with my best friend, but i feel bad about it, because i also feel that im in love with my girlfriend of 3 months. sometimes i just wish my best friend would dump her boyfriend and that my girlfriend would dump me so that finally we could be together. but then other times i feel as if i never want to be without my girlfriend.
