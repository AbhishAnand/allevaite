Your illness

I'm sorry you have a mental illness. I'm so sorry sometimes you say the worst things imaginable to me. I know you can't help it and it's not true. I'm even more sorry I fight back. I don't want to or even mean to, but I do. I'm sorry I always think you're wrong. It has come to me that I was wrong along the way as well. I'm sorry if I have devalued you because of your illness. I'm sorry I haven't treated my husband the way he deserves to be treated.
