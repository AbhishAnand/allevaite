Malpractice Lawsuit

I am a lawyer. Almost 10 years ago I represented a client in a medical malpractice lawsuit against a large and powerful healthcare clinic. However, I was being paid by the clinic to drain my client's assets with protracted litigation, furnish the clinic with recordings of all meetings and telephone conversations with my client and coordinate a dismissal of the case the day before the trial was to begin. The guilt is almost overbearing but to seek forgiveness from him directly would be suicide for me and my career. Will God forgive me anyway?
