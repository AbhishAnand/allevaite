I'm materialistic and

I'm materialistic and recently, things have been getting out of control. If a bag isn't Louis Vuitton or Gucci, I won't carry it. If jewelry isn't from Tiffanys, I won't wear it. I spend my parents' money on accessories because I feel as if I "need" them and after a while, I feel guilty. I try to stop but its like a never ending cycle I go through.
