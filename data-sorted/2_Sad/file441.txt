Unwanted Thoughts

Every day, I try to keep from willingly sinning. I am conscientious of what I say and do. Despite this, I have horrible thoughts that pop up into my head unwillingly. They started off as just one or two bad thoughts a day and it's now gotten up to 20+ unwanted thoughts a day. The thoughts are really horrible, ranging from flashes of my family's pet dog being stabbed repeatedly to my friends being decapitated--things that are so repulsive to me that I can't believe that I am even capable of such thoughts. I've tried to pray the thoughts away, but they still haven't subsided. I hate them and they scare me, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to a psych because I don't want anyone to know that I have this problem. I feel like an evil person. I wish someone could help me.
