Why ????"
you know I still Love you, but I don't want you anymore. When you first left all I wanted was you back. That is not longer the way things are. I still think about you alot, I guess that is because of all the good times we spent together. The one little part of me that wants you back is for you to help me. Help me with the mess you made before you left and the mess you made worse after you left. I want to get things in my life back together with your help it could be done so easily. I think that would help both of us out. I know you feel guilty for what you have done and no one can change that. But you can help it if you would just help fix the mess you caused. I can't see myself getting involved with anyone until the mess is cleaned up. I now have the means to get it all straightened up if you would just help me out some. I still have the papers you signed that has caused all the problems.
