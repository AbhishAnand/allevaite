i dont know..

i'm scared. i have a good life. good friends. i'ma christian. but i do such bad things and i hate myself for it. I only bring pain and suffering to other people because i'm selfish and prideful. If i was never born. if i could take life into my own hands i think it'd be better if i just died. my friends, brothers, family they all worry and care about me so much i feel like such a bother in life. i dont know how to stop feeling like this. i love life. but at the same time it hurts so much. this world is so full of corruption and i dont know how i feel. Whether to be mad or sad or depressed. i dont show any of it. but sometimes. sometimes i just want to talk to one person about it. but i dont want people to judge me. life is so weird. but that's part of it right? i feel kind of better?.
