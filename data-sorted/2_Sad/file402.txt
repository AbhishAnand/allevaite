Tae Kwon Do Tear Up

So I just finished a martial arts class and I must confess that I really went to far while sparring them. It all goes back about two weeks ago when a new 24 year old student joined ( I am 17). He bore a white belt and I introduced myself and my brother to him, took him under our wing if you will. Then we begin to sparr towards the end of class (sparring is controlled fighting). I go easier on him then other students since he was "just beginning" but as it turns out he was almost my belt at another school. Things are going fine until he punches me square in the chest with all his might. I slam against the wall and punch a huge hole in the lower floor boards. Reeling in pain I get up only to have him hit me again. After that class I swore, I would return the favor and I did. I did it tonight in front of the whole school. Kicked the living heck out of him and to be perfectly honest... I was embarassed. I was embarassed that a little jerk like him got the best of me. And in front of fellow students and their parents, those who look up at me, I set a horrible example. I just wanted to confess that I am sorry to my students, my teacher and my school. It will never happen again... and kyle ( this was the kids name)... you had it coming
