skinny

i look up pictures of people online who are skinny. I want to be them. i recite the mantras that are on the pictures in my head over and over again. I keep a journal on how much i eat and how much i work out. each day i feel like its too much. even when i feel like fainting i still try not to eat. You indulge, you buldge.
