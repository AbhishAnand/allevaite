'You've really improved'.

I was a horrible student in seventh and eighth grade. I got horrible grades and dressed lazily and just didn't care about anything. Come freshman year of high school, I tried harder, got Bs and one or two Cs. Now I am a sophomore in high school, getting As and Bs. My parents are telling me how proud they are of my and that I've really improved from my old self. It hurts to think that maybe they didn't like me two years ago, and every time they told me they loved me they might have been lying.
