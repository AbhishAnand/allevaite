I miss you.

He was the first person I ever fell in love with. He was really the first person I ever allowed myself to love at all. He meant the world to me and made my life so beautiful. He broke up with me because he said he loved me too much to be so young. Now he's telling similar lies to his new boyfriend. He told him he hates me and never wants to see me again over the phone while shaking his head at me to let me know it wasn't true. I wonder how many times he was shaking his head at others while reassuring me that we would make it. He is a liar. I don't even know the person i fell in love with, but I miss him so much.
