please help me

i took my best friends ipod when i was drunk to copy the music off of it because our internet wasn't working at home, i meant to put it back the next day but she thought someone else had stolen it so i kept it at home for a few weeks and waited til i could put it back but i told her i had it and apologized to her. She took it okay and said it didn't matter but now her mum's been ringing me when she's drunk and i really can't face her because we were really close. Can i feel any more ashamed? I didn't mean to. I'm never drinking again. could someone help me pleae?
