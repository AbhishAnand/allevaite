i did a bad thing

i've been worried about his relationship with this girl he knows from back home so i checked his texts to see how much they'd been in touch with each other. thing is, i accidentally pressed the wrong button and called her from his phone... i'm praying to god the missed call doesn't show up or they don't think anything of it cos i was wrong not to trust him and i'm so afraid i'll lose the best thing that ever happened to me
