I'm sorry

I can't believe that it is over. We had one of the best friendships, and I had never experienced that strong of a connection in a friendship with a guy. We had so much fun for the longest time, and it's just so hard to accept the fact that it is over. I wish it wasn't now. I don't know how to tell you I'm sorry, but I wish you could understand how much I will miss you and how our friendship used to be. I had been selfish and now you have decided to leave. I don't know when I will be able to get over this, it's the summer all over again. You can be such a wonderful person sometimes, and I will miss you so much. Im sorry and thank you for everything.
