Animal Abuse

As a former vegetarian I feel ashamed to say I've taken out my aggression on my family's pet when it urinates in the house... for some reason punishing that dog brings out the darkest side of me. I've strangled it and beaten it badly. I realize how terrible these acts are and I know this effects my karma in the most awful kind of way. I pray for forgiveness and will from now on try to treat it with the respect it deserves as one of God's own.
