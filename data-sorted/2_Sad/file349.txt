Hope she is doing well

Twenty-seven years ago I dumped a girl after a night of kissing on a school trip. I'm sure she felt she was being used, but I really did it because of the age difference (17 and 14). I was cowardly and did not want to be known as a senior who could only get a freshman girlfriend. I rarely spoke to her after that, and wish today that I knew whatever became of her so I could apologize -- not for the kissing, but for the horribly degrading way I just told her to get lost the next day.
