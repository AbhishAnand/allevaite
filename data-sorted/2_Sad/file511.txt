animal abuse...

All my life ive made impulse buys of all kinds of animals: birds, rabbits, rats, axolots, turtles, mice, and most recently a dog. i guess i get comfort from taking care of them because i dont get along with people. but it seems the novelty always wears off and i end up abandoning them. once i left two mice in a tank without food for over a week and the bigger mouse had eaten the smaller one. i killed an axolotl simply because i was too lazy to change the water. ive let turtles go in a park pond, and abandoned a rat on a roof from a 2nd floor window. i did this knowing fully it probably wouldnt survive. also when i was 15 and had a pet parrot, it wasnt acting the way i wanted it to so i got frustrated, put it in a box and shook it very hard. the parrot was injured. ive also hit rabbits in anger. i got a puppy on impulse the other week and at first i was very caring and did my best to care for him. i spent over $500 in vet bills. but i found it harder and harder to control my temper when he whined, and i hit him twice. today i got in a cab and took him to a park, and left him there. hes only 9 weeks old. im scared of myself that i could do something like that almost robotically, without any emotion. the reason i didnt give him to a shelter is because i dont want people to know what an irresponsible animal abuser i am. i even have a plan to say he was stolen, and play the victim. ive never hurt an animal for pleasure, but the times i abused my bird/rabbit/dog, it was definitely abuse because i was taking my anger out on them. the scary thing is i also have a cat, ive never hurt him and hope i never will. i know people like me shouldnt have animals. im seeing a therapist but this is the one thing i could never, ever tell another human being in person. i know people who read this are going to be disgusted. honestly i dont really care how you react because i disgust myself too and i just wanted to get this off my back anonymously.
