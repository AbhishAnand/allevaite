Am i a bad person?
I met this guy a few years ago, online. he wa amazing to talk to and i found myself falling in love with him. the problem is that i finally met in person him a few months after we met, and i found out his looks were not as amazing as his personality. i'm ashamed to say that i can't even go anywhere in public with him because i'm pretty good looking and i think being with him makes me look bad.
