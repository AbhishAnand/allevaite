i wish i was dead

every day i consider breaking up with you. every day you give me reasons to break up. forgetting me and ignoring me was painful enough. not to mention the yelling, hitting and cheating. despite all this i love you but i am never 100% certain i want to be with you. you make me feel like garbage again and again. we have 2 children together so i pray for new horizons, but its always at my expense. i dont feel loved by you. why i can't i stop this horrible path with you? why do you insist you love me? is it out of guilt? i wish i was dead.
