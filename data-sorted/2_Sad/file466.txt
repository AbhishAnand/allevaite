Love or Late?

I tell him I love him. But he's hurt me before and I'm not sure if I honestly love him or if its too late. Now he says he's different and I don't know. I think I might be too. He says we're never breaking up again. But maybe thats exactly what I want, to break up. I can trust. How do you expect me to love? "I love you." I'll lie. "I love you too." He'll say. I'll never know if he's telling the truth this time or not. Hell, I'm even losing sight on my honesty.
