I hope to god...

i know that i am in love with you,even though we have never met. I feel it hard in the pit of my stomach.You have helped me so much & finally i am starting to feel complete.You let me depend on you when i keep afloat by myself.Because of you i feel beautiful & i am no longer ashamed of my "kinks". But i am so afraid i won't be attracted to you & that i'll ruin everything. Your beautiful,& i hope to god i will be able to see that in person.
