Karma sux

I am in love with this girl I work with, she is beautiful, athletic, charming, intelligent and very dark and mysterious. I love everything about her even her glasses. shes always at the computer and i'm always, doing field work. but some how I know she feel the same way. I met her in the military, me and her were in A/s school together and people just thot we were weird because we always sat alone, through texas, california, and Japan, we suffer though our job, harsh studying, taking orders, waking up at 2 in the morning, doing stupid drill. and endurance training . When I see her, It was like, I'm in a dream, she enchanted me with her haunting beauty, her humble eyes, and with her beautiful smile. I know we can't be together so I decided to get myself kicked out of the military. I love her so much, I thought it would be a good thing to get kick out, but it was a big mistake, I was put in jail, I had no money, no direction, I mean I'm just a kid that join after high school, now I'm out, and regreting that I will never see her again, I am such a dumb azz......, Now the Government hate me, even tho I serve 2 and a half years, my family don't know what to think of me and realizing I will never see her again, Kills me. I got a cell phone with everyone in the military number and got it stolen, now she don't know where I am, and I don't know where she is since the military sometime require everyone to travel. I can not get over the pain and my best friend told me to move on but I have no idea how to, i just can not forgive myself,... all my energy and intelligent that I had before left me, I was fast and strong and have a good head on my shoulder, now, I feel like everything I know and do is a waste I am Depressed. is like I'm holding your breath under freezing cold water. repeating in my mind over again and again I'm all alone, and i felt that no one would understand me..... Karma sux.
