FORE!

in elementary school in the 4th grade my class with another class was going to the state capital. we stopped at burger king for breakfast and we got alot a napkins and a straw for milk...(Mischeiviess grin) I liked to make every one look at me so i made the rest of the way fun. I spit spitballs at everyone on the bus! it was a really fancy bus. It had small tv screnes so I shot some at that, i shot some a the window near a boy i liked. Then i shot one up to the front and it landed in one of the popular girls hair! she lived by me and got so mad at me! I had to sit by the teacher on the way back which really stunk cause that meant no talking with my friends....
