i still cry

i dont wanna be cocky. but i think im a pretty decent guy. not too hard on the eyes. generally confident. athletic. smarter then most of my class. but with all that i still am torn apart by my ex gf. we broke up almost a year ago. and i still find myself thinking about it n getting all teary eyed. just hearing a song i listened to when we were together. or smelling the perfume she used to wear in a store. it happens everywhere. shes the only thing that ever cld make me cry. and i cant seem to stop. i havnt even seen her for a good 6 months. i dunno what to do. im not sure if i can ever feel the same about another girl. and trust me. iv tried. its just not the same. im so disconnected and spacy about girls now. im not interested in beautifuly shaped school girls walking by. i barely notice when there talking to me. im just not interested anymore. i just think of my ex i cant stop.
