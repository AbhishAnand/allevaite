Im broke

I am broke, I am a professional that lives in a nice house, who is happly married with children and I am broke. my credit cards are max'ed, I am upside down on a minivan, I have $40 in the bank. I had to spend my 401k of $36000 to help us with a layoff. I have no retirement. I am 38 and feel like I will be working for the rest of my life just to stay out of a nursing home. My wife tells me not to worry about it, but she has always been care free and go lucky. I do not know what I am going to do.
