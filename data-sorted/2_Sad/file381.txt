Love a different woman

I'm married, but I love someone from my high school days. We were good friends, but then got pissed off at each other and didn't talk for years. After we both got married, we got back in touch and we're good friends again, but I seriously regret the years we were apart. We lived in different cities in high school (about 4 hours apart), so we never had a romantic relationship, but I really do love her, and always have. I also love my wife though, so I can't endanger my marriage with a relationship, and I'm not even sure she feels the same way. *sigh* Sometimes life can be cruel.
