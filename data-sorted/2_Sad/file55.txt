After he left my life, it took me a very long time to recover. I became extremely depressed and only this year have returned to a state of normal behavior. During this time period I think I went on 2 dates, both with different guys. I wasn't really interested in either one of them, in fact the very thought of their possible affection for me was a bit revolting. However, I needed to go out on those dates, because even though I felt absolutely nothing for those boys my need for acceptance and normality overcame my disgust.
