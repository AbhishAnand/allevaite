ever since i

ever since i broke up with my last boyfriend a few months ago, i've been thinking of him all the time. it makes it hard to live, because i haven't met a guy as wonderful as him. and the worst part is, he doesn't even know if he still loves me or not, so i don't know if we'll end up together again in the end. goddamnit... ._.
