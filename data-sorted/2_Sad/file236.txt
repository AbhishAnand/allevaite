Gave up on God

I've been going through a crazy ordeal in my life where, at one time I was minding my own business. Then I got into the trucking industry. As a woman, I was the target of these men harrassing me, constantly and stalking me. Spreading lies about me, ruining my reputation. I've always been a Christian, trying to do the right thing, trying to live my life right. And all of a sudden. I felt God abandoned me to these hateful men and others who are being men and evil toward me. My friends, who I found out were never really my friends turned against me. How can people you've known most of your life, suddenly listen to gossip about you and turn on you. The elders in the congregation never offered help and knew about the situation, but they never was there to help me anyway. I was so down spiritually at different times in my life. Not coming to the meetings, did I ever get a phone call of encouragement. No one ever cared and no one does now. So I see God has never been there for me and he's abandoned me now. Why should I give allegence to someone who does not protect me from what I'm going through, but these evil people keep living their lives and thriving and all I get is people going out of their way to be hurtful to me. I do have a feeling of trying to pick up the Bible, but what's the use, he doesn't hear me, he's abondoned me and he's left me on my own. I'm all alone and I've never been totally alone. Everyone has abandoned me and they think I'm a joke and it's so funny to see me alone. I'll get my own vengence one day, screw everyone and God too.
