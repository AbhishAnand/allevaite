Today was my birthday.

Dear Aiden, I really love you and care about you-more than you could possibly know. Every day I was glad to listen to your stories and hear about your day. I would do anything for you. But today - Today was my birthday. And you didn't even call. Today, for once, I don't even want to hear about what you did. Today was my birthday. And you forgot. That's how it is right now. You don't even care about me. I am nothing to you. You were my everything. Love always
