Mistreated a classmate
When I was in first & second grade, I was involved in harassing & making fun of a girl in my class. I think she was from a rather poor family & would sometimes come to school without bathing or not dressed appropriately for the weather. Once, a "friend" pointed out that she was not wearing underpants as the whole class sat in a circle & listened to the teacher read. We sat & whispered & giggled about it until the girl realized what we were doing. She was just mortified. I'm 40 years old & I've done worse things than this, but THIS is the thing I'm most remorseful for. She moved away a couple of years later & I have no way of finding her to apologize. I'm actually afraid that if I were to track her down & apologize, she would just tell me to go to hell. I hope she has had a good life & I'm terribly sorry for my behavior. I hope she would forgive me but I'm not a forgiving person myself & it's a horrible way to live. - M
