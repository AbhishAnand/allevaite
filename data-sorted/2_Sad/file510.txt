if only

I broke up with my old boyfriend a long time ago to go out with someone that ended up tearing me apart. I Miss the one I left. I sent him a song that reminds me of him and he and I are still really good friends. But I moved to the east coast and I miss him so much. He is moving to Ireland within 3 years and I just want to be with him.. I dont have the guts to tell him either....
