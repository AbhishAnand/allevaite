STILL LOVE HIM

It's been 2 almost 3 years since we broke up. I broke up with him, because it seemed as if he never had the time for him. Now 2 -3 years later i still always think about him form time to time. I've been in 2 long term relationships (2 one-ish year relationships) since i broke up with him, yet i still have abnormally strong feelings for him. Everytime i see him my heart skips a beat and my body freezes. What's stupid is, i only dated him for 3 months and yet he has this lasting effect on me. I know what he does and who he likes, yet he knows nothing, about me anymore? I still love him to this day, yet he doesn't notice me. I really do still miss him, and i do hope one day he'll notice me because i've always been watching over him in a way.
