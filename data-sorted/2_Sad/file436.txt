I hate myself

when i was younger i did some things that i am now still not able to admit to people. it stops me from becoming close to people i meet and may become friends with. i can t stop thinking about the things i did and people i destroyed. death will be my release but i won't kill myself cause of my family and its a dumb way to fix" your problems so i will be living with these thoughts until i die of natural causes or something else.
