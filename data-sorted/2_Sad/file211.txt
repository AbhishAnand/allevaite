liar

I am a compulsive liar. I live a made up life that all of my friends think is true, but it isn't. They all think I came from a very wealthy family when my parents are actually really poor and i am embarrassed by my family. Sometimes I think about coming clean, but it would be too hard now. I have been telling this lie for 10 years.
