I love my best friend..

I'm in love, I admit it. I'm totally in love with my best friend. When we first met we kind of had something for a week, nothing really happened. It was for just a week, I felt pretty bad when she told me her feelings for me were.. gone. When it happened. I had hurt her, emotionally. A bit later, I started liking a good friend of hers, she was attracted to me as well. Things eventually grew into a relationship. That relationship was based on the lie that I was done with my best friend. I infact never was over her. During my relationship my love actually grew. I love my best friend more then anything in the world. I need her in my life. And yet.. she'll never be there for me like I am for her. Late '07 things were said which caused me, when she was trying to give me a kiss on my cheek, to turn my head so she kissed me on the lips instead. It felt really great, better then with my (by this time ex-) girlfriend. In doing so I damaged her trust in me... Just before '08 there was a brief moment in which hope sparked in me. I was at her place and she was at one point, and she never does this, lying/sitting against me with her head on my chest... A couple times I couldve kissed her, thats how close we were... What the hell can I do to either get over her or get her.. I know I need to let her go but I don't want to...
