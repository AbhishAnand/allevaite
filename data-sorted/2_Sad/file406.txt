my ex-boyfirend

the thing is, when i saw that you spent our old anniversary day with your new girlfriend, i felt a pang of.. i don't know.. old times. we were together five years, and i tried so hard to make it work. and the last time we were together, you broke up with me. our love was so tumultuous.. and you really were an awful boyfriend... but god damn it, i loved you so very much. and i felt a pang of that. .. as much as i felt that, a part of me feels sorry for your new girlfriend, since you were a huuge money sink and took alot of emotional tending. unless you changed, because you have everything- eveyrthing a girl could want, if you've mended your ways...i guess i'll never know. and i made my choice to say goodbye.... haha. although you are wearing my hat in your new pic with your naieve new gf... hahaha. omg, what was i thinking?... i don't know anything anymore.
