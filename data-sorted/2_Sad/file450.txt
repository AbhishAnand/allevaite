old flame

i used to think we might be together. then she got married. today i learned she is now divorced. we have started talking again and are meeting next week. i can't stop thinking about her. my current 'girlfriend' is several hours away - it is not going anywhere. i haven't been this wrapped up about a girl in years. trying to play it cool, but i really want her BAD
