Loving the Dead???

I'm madly in love with two people, their brilliant and everything I love. However, they are both dead. One died two years before I was born, the other three years after I was born. Thats weird isn't it. They where both famous people but I'm not saying who. Its kind of upseting when my relatives say to me, you will meet the right guy someday. I don't want anyone else. Hopefully when I die I'll see them, thats my life long wish. However I could eventually fall in love with someone who is alive, It happened once but he was a total jerk! I'm 18 years old by the way.
