Fat Men

I am 25 years old, petite and attractive by modern standards. I'm a female. I have a thing for fat guys - 300-500 lbs. My fiance' is 350 lbs. He has been losing weight, just a little, lately. And I wish instead that he was gaining weight. We have a perfect, loving relationship so I feel very guilty about this. I could never tell him but I could never live without him either. I will suffer in silent guilt forever.
