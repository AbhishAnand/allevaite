I'm scared

I'm scared that one day my boyfriend will see me for what I really am and leave me. He makes me so happy and says that he loves me, but I find it really hard to accept that anyone could love me for what I am. I suffer with depression and low self-esteem, which makes me feel useless and my last relationship was with a physically and psychologically abusive guy. He lived with me for 15 months and I got used to being treated badly, so now I flinch if my boyfriend raises his voice at me and I constantly apologise if I think I've done anything wrong. I try to tell him what's wrong, but because he cares so much, he ends up interrupting me to tell me that I'm not fat, or stupid, or useless, which is very sweet, but then I feel like he doesn't really value what I am saying to him. I hate what I am, and the fact that I feel that I have no control over changing it. I wish I was a better person, because he deserves someone so much better than me.
