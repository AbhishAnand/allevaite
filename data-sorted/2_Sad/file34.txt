Friends, Family, and Life.
I am currently 20 years old residing at my mothers house. Living off of her... though more so she's living off of me. She has to take care of my sisters 3 kids; 7 year old girl, 6 year old girl, and a 14 month old. When the 14 month was first born was the day all the kids were taken away from her. My sister currently has 6 kids, which she is responsible for none of, currently. Which I find very unfair... She brings children into this world, and we're forced to take care of them. Where's the logic in this? But I digress...
