Can't order a drink..

This is really sad...but I am afraid to go out with my friends to a bar...because I don't want to order a drink at the bar...with a bartender...I am afraid to..I don't know why I just am. Some of the fear is that I am afraid of "how to order" and then how to tip..and where the money goes..and so on. I have been 21 for 9 months now and have only been to a 3 bars. 2 ON my 21st bday and one a month later...but I had my friend order my drink...she was like what the heck? SO..since then...I have not been out...I tell my friends I am on a budget and can't afford it...which is somewhat true...but mostly..it is because I am afraid. It sucks too because I am young and cute! I have great friends...the only thing holding me back is that dumb fear...and I KNOW it is dumb! LOL. i hate seeing all my friends pics on Facebook and stuff..out drinking and having a good time..without me...and they have no idea why... I am probably the only one in the WORLD with this fear.
