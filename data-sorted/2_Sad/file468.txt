dear boy that i can't live without

dont worry its nothing bad... well it might be idk... so heres the thing i rly need to hang out with you not because i always dream about it and always wish for it, not because u seem like the kewlest kid alive, not because i feel i can tell you alot, what is about is... I NEED to see you because well like i like you and i know that seems weird because we dont rly know each other it seems but i do kno alot about u and u know alot about me... i want to become closer friends and i kno the whole likeing thing wont go anywhere but i cant hold it back anymore. I dream//daydream about going down there and us having the time of our lives and the worst part i always feel is awakeing from it and realizeing it was a dream... sorry if this is like not the way u want/wanted it to go bc i can pretend i nvr said this if its what you want... all i want to say is even though i have a bf i feel bad when i do something with him bc im thinking of where you live, and i am thinkin of wat would be the first thing i said to you when i see you for the first time... You have to be RLY tired bc you keep running in and out of my mind! i kno that a chessy pick up line but im not using it as a pick up line im using it as the truth. i felt i had to tell you so there it is... if you nvr wanna talk to me im ok with it i will just have to recover... if you wanna talk and feel at all the same god i will be so excited and ur probly like i have a gf well hello i have a bf i RLY like and im saying this... well thats it... so idk kno if this goodbye or just hello so all im gonna say is .. your totally a great friend and i understand any thing you say or do...
