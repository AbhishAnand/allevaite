If You Love Me, Won't You Let Me Know?

We've loved each other for a long time now. He's a controlling, guilt-tripping jerk, but she won't leave him (and I've thought this well before I fell for her). She says she just wants to have us both, but keeps moving on with her life with him. And then she doesn't understand why I get upset. I feel like a jerk for getting upset in the first place. I should probably just stop seeing her, but I'm sure everyone knows how love is. I'll stay by her until she tosses me out, and my heart's going to get shredded harder than ever before, but I don't care. I still have hope that she'll be with me, and we'll live out our days a happy couple.
