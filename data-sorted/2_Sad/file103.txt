I feel so alone

My parents divorced a year ago, and I still feel so alone. It was my dads fault and my mam still cries about it every night even though she has a new boyfriend. My dads seeing a married woman and every day I hate her more and more for being such a jerk and him for being such an idiot. I just want to curl up and die somewhere. I have no one to talk to, and I think I might be bipolar because my moods change constantly and I find myself at my most creative when I'm at my most depressed. I don't want to go to see the doctor because they'll tihnk I'm an idiot. I also get heart palpitations and anaemia. There's a history of bulimia in my family. I'm worried about what I'm going to do to myself.
