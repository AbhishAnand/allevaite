Failure Of A Marriage

I have failed at my marriage. I expect to be separated within a few days. I have many regrets. My largest regret by far is the impact of this separation/divorce upon my children. I own the pervasive feeling I could have done better. Not much of a secret, true, but scratch at the bottom and you'll find more bottom. How could I have done better? When all is said and done, whatever I did and didn't do was insufficient to make my partner feel special and loved and engaged and excited, etc. We have slowly exchanged, inch by inch and hour by hour, a loving relationship for bitterness and acrimony. I stayed with her because of my children and what we once were to each other. I should have (but could not) figure out how to make it work. This is a shoddy night..
