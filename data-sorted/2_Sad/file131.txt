Married the Wrong Man

It's near my 3rd wedding anniversary, and my daughters 2nd birthday, and I still think I married the wrong man. I loved someone else for 5 years before I met my now husband, and when my first love got shipped overseas I decided he was never coming back and I better marry my bf before he finds someone better than me. My first love did come back, and I still think about him everyday. The worst part is, I dont really feel guilty about it, I just hope my husband doesnt ever realize he was my 2nd choice, not my first.
