I don't know if I ever loved you

I don't know if I ever loved you. I loved you only because you loved me. I thought you meant security and humor, for the rest of my life, but then you left, slowly, and left me to do all of the compromising. But I still never loved you, not really. I grieved, but I knew I didn't love you. My grief was of what I'd given you, trying to make myself into a person that could be with you forever. But I knew I would rather be by myself than be with you. I knew that there was someone better, even though we haven't met yet. I knew that I'd rather be alone, or experiment than be with you. I knew that I was wasting my time by giving you everything. I knew that you were self righteously making me give up myself to be with you, and I let you, because I wanted to be able to give you everything. At least I know that you weren't worth it. There was nothing else I could have possibly given you.
