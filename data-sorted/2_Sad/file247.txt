I'm dreaming of people I don't know, but them come to know

Does this happen to anyone else? Has anyone besides myself ever had a dream that included people you don't know in your real life, and then after some time passes you meet them or pass them as you walk by? Or how about events or images? And then something happens or you see the image you couldn't get out of your head for a long time, not knowing why? This is happening more often than when I was a child. Even then I didn't know what to do. So, has this ever happened to anyone else or does anyone know what this is called? Thanks.
