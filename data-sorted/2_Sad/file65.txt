threw out

I threw the keys to my filing cabinet in the dumpster becauase I was looking at my keychain while walking down the street one day and I was wondering what the hell they were for. I thought they were keys to an old bike lock. I'm so stupid, now I have to get a new filing cabinet. Thankfully my filing cabinet was unlocked though at the time I threw them out.
