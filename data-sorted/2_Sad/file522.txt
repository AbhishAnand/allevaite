does he love me anymore?

Iv been with my bf for nearly a year now, he says he's in love with me and that Im the only girl for him.But hes just so negative, he always makes comments that were not going to be together in the future and makes me feel really bad about myself sometimes. I dont think he finds me attractive anymore either cause of some of the things he says to me. I tottaly in love with him and i think about if I was'nt with him and it breaks my heart. Just dont know wat to do...
