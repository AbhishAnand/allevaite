Totally detatched of love

I'm so consumed with myself and my new business that I have time for no one. It worries me that I don't care all that much about it either. My second divorce was final last year, and I can't date because I can't concentrate on another being for very long. I've always been self-centered and I fear I won't even try love again. I used to be caring and attentive and a good lover. Now I feel like a robot sometimes. My kicks come from squashing my business competition.
