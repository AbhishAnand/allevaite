i constantly dwell

i constantly dwell on my poor actions, the past, and any other problems that i have. It keeps me up late at night, and i cant sleep. i try to talk to friends, but i feel alone still. i dont know what to do anymore and its hurting my grades, and affecting my perspective on life...and i'm just going crazy. i feel like i'm going to break down and cry.
