Moving Away From Family

I just had a baby and feel the need to get the hell out of WV where we have horrible hospitals and schools. We will be moving to NC where they have excellent schools, great hospitals, jobs, better weather, and friendlier people. Everything is good about it, except I am 100 percent crushed and broken hearted to be moving away from my mother. I have never loved my mother so much until I had a baby of my own. I think it will tear me to pieces to leave her. My mom and dad won't move with me, and that breaks my heart even more. I'm taking their grandchild away from them. I'm robbing my baby of the best grandmother in the world. I'm hurting so badly. I know it's the right thing to do, but it feels so wrong. I can't stay here, but I can't go without my mother. I feel so stupid.
