whats wrong with me....

it started out as a little white lie... it just a little white lie, meant to brush someone's rude comments off.... I dont know how it happened but its become a monster, I'm so deep in this lie I cant get out. The worst part is I'm starting to believe it, I'm losing my mind because I cant tell the difference anymore. My life is about too fall a part because of I cant seperate whats real & whats not.... I'm on the verge of losing my job & my mate, both are the best things that have ever happened to me... I just want to all to end... I dont want to lie, I dont want to feel like this, i want to know who & what I am..... I just want to at peace to be stable, to be... Normal....
