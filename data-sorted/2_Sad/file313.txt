my best friend

My confession is that i'm jealous of my best friend, she everything........for example, guys think i'm hot but think she's hotter and she ends up with them. And it hurts because when i like a guy, he's so strung up on her that he doesn't see that she doesn't want him and i would treat him right. She gets all the attention from guys. I love the way i look, i love myself and i think i'm really hot and smexy (LOL) but everytime i'm around her i loose my confidence and i just let her have her way. The thing is right now in my country, red girls are in and black girls are out (no joke i'm serious...it's bad) and i'm just hating this phase. I love her like a sister and she is such a good friend but i can't take it anymore. another example, last year i join facebook, i have 200 hundred friends from that like 135 are boys, i introduced her two months ago and she has 356 friends and 231 are guys and i don't know why it's bothering me... .....i hate felling like this but the truth is ....I AM JEALOUS OF MY BEST FRIEND!!!!!
