I wish every guy would wear make-up. It just enhances looks-that's what it is for. though i rarely use it myself. i just think it makes some guys look so good! i feel silly typing in anything in these confessions. i am 19 and have never even kissed someone else. and I am hot also. I am extremely attractive. i just tend to find people disgusting...they repulse me more often than they attract me. i'm only interested in the most beautiful people. then i find one thing about them that is unattractive and i cannot get over it. i promise you if i walked past you, you would think DAMN that girl is gorgeous. i like my dad way better than my mom. If he died i would be so unhappy. Things considered wrong i am usually scared of doing. like anything illegal. i pee in the pool constantly. i like japanese comics.
