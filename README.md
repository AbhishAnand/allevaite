  >  ### Your Mental Health matters

   It is important to share your feelings with us so that we can help you to the best of our ability and try to understand what you are going through. Keeping things bottled can be unhealthy and could lead to severe issues like anxiety, depression ... .Not everyone understands what you are going through, but opening up to us just to let your feelings out and vent about a problem that has been building is a great way to release all that tension that has been building for so long.
