falling for a coworker

I've worked here for 4 years. I've felt chemistry with one of my female coworkers from the very beginning. Recently, she has become much more flirty. This change has only intensified my feelings for her. I think about her constantly. Problem is, I'm engaged to a woman I've been with for 8 years. The thought of hurting her kills me. Thinking about my coworker is equally as painful, because I know we can never be together. I sit and think about her for hours. She's perfect in every way, but she'll probably never know how I really feel about her.
