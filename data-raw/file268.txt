I check my college boyfriend's blog

I check his blog every couple of months - not because I miss him, but because it's gratifying to see how boring he and his new wife are. He dumped me after he found out I was pregnant in college because he wanted to date my best friend. It's so fun to see what a loser he still is! Take heart people...sometimes a breakup is the best thing that can happen to you, even though it may not feel that way at the time.
