I forgot him

I was friends with him for months. we dated for a month. it ended. i don't know how i feel. but one thing is for sure. sometimes i forget we were even together until i see a picture or him, or i think of how much money i spent that day. i am not sure if i miss him or the time wasted. its sad but true. i realize he was nothing to me, just something to keep me more busy. maybe that's what he figured out and broke it off. I never meant to hurt him, he was just to hard up. but again i forget we were together....is that bad?
