I hate myself

I hate myself. I honestly can't bring myself to hate anyone else, not even my abuser. When there's a character in a book or TV show that's MEANT to be irritating or stupid, it takes me a good 5-10 minutes to appreciate that because I'm so set on trying to be accepting of everyone else. When it comes to me, it's a totally different story. I think I am the most disgusting, foul creature on the planet and I honestly believe I deserved all the horrible things that've happened in my life. I don't know whether it's because the guy who tried to hurt me made me think that or it's just inherent knowledge but it's got to the point where I just don't care any more. All I want is to vanish and give the people who wasted their time trying to fix me their lives back.
