goodnight kiss

The other night, you kissed me goodnight. It was nothing really. It was just a drunken peck on the lips because that's where I pointed in my drunken stupor. But it was the first kiss I've ever had that I haven't been able to get out of my head. You're my friend and coworker and you're amazing and I love how your wit matches mine every second of the day. And now I'm afraid I won't be able to look you in the face...because I'll be picturing your lips on mine, and the love I'll never get from you because you're hers.
