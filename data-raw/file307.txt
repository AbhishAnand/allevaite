I love you

i told my bf he was the first person i ever said i love you to, but its not true. i got caught up and a lame internet thing and i felt guilty for not liking the guy as much and i told him i loved him and convinced myself i liked him more than i did. I look at it as my one do over. That im allowed to make that one mistake, so it didn't really count
