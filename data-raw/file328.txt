In love

I'm still in love with you, even though we broke up so long ago. I guess you'll never feel the same way about me, but I still love you with all of my heart. You were my first love and you've always been there for me. Sometimes I want to tell you how I feel but I know you wouldn't like it. I just have to be contented with the sweet agony it is to be around you at work. I wish more than anything that you would just reach out and touch me. Your smile makes me melt on the inside, and when you say my name I always smile. I love you.
