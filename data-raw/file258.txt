is this cheating?

So I am tossing and turning. I cannot get MJ out of my head. I try and I try. I wonder what if she was the one. We were both much younger but still at an age when people can start their 'forever.' If Y (current serious girlfriend) finds this I am a dead man. Perhaps it would be of note that I tied G's (most serious ex) shoelaces in a dream two weeks back. More dead man material. Now back to MJ. We held each other once, it was an eternal embrace. At that time I was in the pre-stage of being with M and I could not betray that. I should have. I still remember vividly. Her soft cheeks brushing against mine, lips being carefully avoidant, but they knew what they wanted. I'll never forget her warm body and bosom pressing against me. Oh god, if I believed in one, take me back to that embrace. I wouldn't have pussied out and asked to be taken home. We both wanted things from each other that night. Couldn't say if they were the same things, but I denied us our night.
