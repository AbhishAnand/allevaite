I despair.

I'm failing my degree at quite a good university, through laziness. In my year, I've cheated with my best mate's girlfriend, I've taken a lot of money from people in drinks and gifts without returning the favour as I'm poor, and worse still I'm living with a group of people who at first seemed wicked to live with, but now seem really boring, forcing conversations about poetry to make themselves feel more intelligent. My mother is yelling at me to get a job, my music career is heading nowhere, and I've been single since a girl broke my heart almost 2 years ago. Lame.
