Got my boss back

We have a HUGE jerk of a supervisor where I used to work. She loves to humiliate her employees and is even super rude to customers. The last shift I worked with her we got in a nasty argument and I decided I was done working there. That same day I went on the company's website and wrote a HUGE complaint about her, pretending to be a customer (because I know they don't take employee complaints seriously). A few days later my friend told me the girl had gotten in a lot of trouble because of a complaint, I knew it was mine! I don't feel a bit bad about it, she deserved it, I watched too many people take her nastyneess and never complain. I just wish she'd been fired.
