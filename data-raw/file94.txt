Broke Up

i broke up with this wonderful gf for no good reason. i was a highschool freshmen and she was a senior and i was too stupid to try to stick with her thru college. all my friends think shes bad cuz of various reasons which are all made up. i made them up. i didnt wanna talk about her cuz i missed her so badly. so i told every1 she cheated on me. but i miss her soo much. and i cant tell anybody. she knows i miss her. we hung out a while ago and we cld tell. jst...its not possible and it makes me depressed. i hate college.
