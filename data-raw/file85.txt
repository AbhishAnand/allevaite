I am faking it

I have a chronic condition called Myathenia Gravis. I have had it since I was about 10 and now I am 30. Its main characteristic is greneral muscle weakness all over the body. Because of certain treatment like chemo. I have developed a scarring on my body that stems from spots of infection not healing correctly. Now it looks as though my upper body was an experiment. Its bad. This affects me daily. People dont understand why I have no love in my life and what am I suppoed to say. Who do you think would want to see that everyday? I struggle with depression because of this and even though I have amazing friends and family there is always a distance I know they feel it but can't put there finger on what it is. They all love me and think I am the best thing ever but I am tired of pretending. I am not the happy go lucky guy I pretend to be all the time. I want out of this but nothing changes and I don't see an end to this charade I have built to be my life. I pray for someting to happen.
