ungrateful

He's everything any girl would dream of in a boyfriend. He's funny, sweet, and constantly goes out of his way to see me and make me happy. If I had to formulate what my perfect boyfriend would be, it would be him. However, for some reason I just don't want to be with him anymore but I feel too guilty to break things off because I have no valid reason.
