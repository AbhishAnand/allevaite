I'll Bear the Punishment

I always feel terrible. I love you, but I feel like if we were together, you would be unhappy. You're so much better than me... You deserve far better than I can give. That doesn't stop me from loving you. I feel self absorbed for hating myself. Is that bad? You're perfect. So perfect. I want so badly to be yours forever. To live with you and to raise your children to be just as magnificent as you. To die happily in your arms after a full life; not alone, empty and tired of trying. But any child of mine would be the next strain of a virus. The world would be a better place without any trace of my existence. I don't want to see you go. If I feel this despair for the rest of my life, if I'm never happy, it would be worth it if you never saw me again and were happy. I can't waste your life any longer. Live it and be free, I can suffer enough for the both of us.
