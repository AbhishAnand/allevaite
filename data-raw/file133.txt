Though I love my fiance, I still like this other guy I've grown fond of over the Internet

I've been with my fiance for over 3 years. We are best friends. But because that was my first relationship I never got to fall in love or be swooned by other guys and so forth. While playing an MMO I got to become really good friends with this guy, he seems... really fun, and have interesting stuff to say! I get a lot of enjoyment logging on everynight and talking to him rather then my boyfriend... we don't really say much to each other, or have anything worthy to talk about for the past year or so...I had a confession from him saying that if I wasn't attached to my boyfriend he would have hit on me! I blushed, alot! I can't really stop thinking about this, but I know in all honesty... in my current situation where he's in the States and I'm half way across the world... it would never really work. Plus I've never seen what he looks like... nor has he...
