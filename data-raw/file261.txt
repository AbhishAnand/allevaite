Not sure if its forever

I was married before, and it lasted 7 years. 7 hellish years. When I finally got over being heartbroken, I vowed NEVER again. 7 years later I have a son and in a relationship same as a marriage. I dont cheat, but sometimes I wonder if the conditions are right if I would. Life is boring, but at least theres no violence like my first marriage. I prob sound like a woman, but Im a guy!
