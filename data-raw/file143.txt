Regret and Bad Timing

I use to know this guy in high school and I really had it for him, but at the time he didn't really want anything to do with me. Now, 2 years later...he's interested. I'm in a relationship with a guy I've been with for over a year. I wonder what could have happened. Why is it always bad timing??
