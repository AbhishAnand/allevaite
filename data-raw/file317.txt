Me

I'm really a very lonely and emotional person. I like to make fun of people like that, call them pathetic and tell them to get real lives rather than sit around and mope, but I do the same thing. Right now, I've just been sitting and staring off into space for about an hour and a half. I do it a lot, especially when I'm about to go to sleep. I think about how I'll never have a wife or even a best friend. I've never had either. I'm 21 and I have no real friends, I don't talk to other people, and I just live my life. I feel like I'm the only person in the world and it keeps me up at night. When ever I really, honestly think about it, my body just gets so heavy, if that makes any sense. It seizes up and my chest contracts, almost painfully. I don't really know what it is but it happens a lot. I hate people like myself, though. The type of person who lives this kind of life and does nothing about it. I'm proud to say I don't complain about being alone or miserable, though. It's really the only part of my personality that I like. I don't want to be a burden to others. Telling them or unloading my problems onto them will only make me more pathetic. I don't like feeling this way, yet I continue to foster the way my life is going. Several years ago, when I was around 17, I sat down with myself and came to the conclusion that I will most likely die alone and without anyone to morn me. Probably from heart failure in my forties or something like that. Now, four years down the line, I find myself wanting to to happen sooner. The only thing that keeps me around is the guilt of knowing what it would do to my parents. When they are gone, will I care anymore? I really don't know, but I also finding myself waiting for that to happen. When I don't have any more emotional attachments. Anyway, don't be like me. That's all I can say.
