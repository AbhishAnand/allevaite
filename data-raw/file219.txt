Witch and Fundie

I have been a practicing Wiccan for 30 years but Recently I connected with the Sky God Jesus and accepted Him. I found a funky little evangelical church and people think I'm "saved" and totally with them but I'm still a witch and do rituals honoring the Goddess and work spells from time to time. I also go to bible study and church and don't see why I can't be a witch and a christian but my church and new christian friends think Wicca is Satanism and they would flip out. So I'm a Wiccan/Evangelical and nobody know except a few Wiccan friends who think it's quite funny. Full moon ritual on sat church on Sunday. I'm sooo going to Hell!
