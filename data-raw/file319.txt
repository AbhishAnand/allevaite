Mistake

I am in love with a Woman I am not with because I married a woman I am not in love with. I married the mother of my beautiful daughter, but I am not in love wiht her. She is a great woman, beautiful, passionate and caring, but I am in love with another woman with all of those attributes and more. She is the woman I think about when I am sleep, the first woman on my mind when I awake. I hurt her so bad when I told her I wanted to see if I could make it work with my daughters mother that she had to start seeing a therapist and has not been to work in over a month. I want to make things up to her, but nothing mends a broken heart but time. God I am sorry I am not honoring my vows to my wife. I have not been with anyone since I got married, but LK has my heart and I don't know if that will ever change.
