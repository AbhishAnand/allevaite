I wish I could hate you

I wish I could hate you for what you did to me. I wish I could hate you others later on for doing the same thing. But I cannot. For you have helped me to find out who I really was - and you helped me to find out who really wanted to still hang out. I cannot hate you despite the fact you appear to still be happy. I cannot wish you ill because I would like to think you no longer wish me ill. And I cannot hate you others because you apologized, and we talked and it was all fine. I don't think you think it is fine at all; and I could hate you for pretending but I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for now. I wish I could hate you but I cannot...because I am afraid that you hate me already.
