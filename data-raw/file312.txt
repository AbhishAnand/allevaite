I Want to Leave

I love a boy with all my heart... and sometimes he says he loves me (if I ask he'll say 'yea') or acts like it, but he'll never say the words. I feel like he's just playing with me. He always insults me. I want to move on and get out of this semi-relationship, where I have all the commitment and responsibility but he has none. But I can't, because I love him, and I promised. I've broken a promise before, and I can't do it again. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so scared sometimes for myself. He's dragging me down. He always says I can leave, but he says it in such a way that threatens me if I do...
