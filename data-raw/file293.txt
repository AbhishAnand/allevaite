sister

I hate my sisters. They are both still kids and one just had a baby, and the other one is pregnant. they are not even 20 yet. I have been trying to have a baby with my fiancee for almost a year now. I'm the oldest. They can't even take care of their own babies. I hate them. I have everything but a baby... Life is so unfair...
