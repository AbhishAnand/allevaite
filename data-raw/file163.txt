I'm always punching myself in the face

Figuratively of course. As it turns out I find myself emotionally involved with 2 women. The circumstances are complex. Since said circumstances do not allow me to share my dilemma with those close to me I will share it here. A little over 6 months ago my girlfriend dumped me. It was entirely unexpected, literally like a bombshell landed in my living room. I was stunned, hurt, and shocked. Within weeks, she was already dating someone else. I was forced to leave our apartment, and she even went as far as to not allow me entry into the apartment to get my own things. Now I was unaware until the breakup that things were this bad. I assumed all was well, a sentiment she echoed to me on numerous occassions. For whatever reason, she decided it was all to much. I spent the next few months drowning myself in booze. I've never been the type to seek absolution in the form of substances. I was simply so distraught over the ordeal that I never managed to find a way to cope normally. Sometime later she randomly calls me, to inform me it was a huge mistake to leave me. We reconnect on some level and things are going well until......Another girl walks into my life, thru Facebook of all things. Just so happens this other girl is my best friend's ex. They've been apart for well over a year (nearly two) and we we're very flirtatious. We hung out a few times, and she told me how much she liked me. Now I find myself desiring both women. On one hand I want what I've always had, but I'm bitter about the betrayal she put me through. Then I want to be with the other girl, but realize the difficulties we'd face letting everyone know. So I'm breaking my own heart on two fronts really. Wanting two things, and realizing it's impossible to have both.
