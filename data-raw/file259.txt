Why you Nick?

It has been over 6 years and I cant seem to let what I feel for you go entirely. Nick, you were the one for me. I wish I would of had the courage to face everything with you. The last night we spent together was amazing, and I remember that sweet sincere look in your beautiful hazel eyes, I wish I didnt let you go back to Sara but I just didnt think I disearved you. -Lost in Yardley-
