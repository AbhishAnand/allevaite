I do nothing at work

I have to be the laziest employee alive, I hope I don't get myself fired... I don't know what's wrong with me, I just don't ever feel like maintaining files or dealing with piles and piles of repetitious paperwork. I've learned to make it look like I'm doing my job, but I'm two weeks behind on things I'm supposed to do daily, and I haven't updated the personnel files in our small department in a good year or so. I'm only now finishing writing the calendar pages for the month of June... it's the 20th already. Who knows when I'll finish July? I tell myself every day I'll do better tomorrow, but it rarely turns out that way. I don't really know what to do.
