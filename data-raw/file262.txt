i love my cousin

I have strong feelings for my first cousin. Can't stop thinking about him today although I know I'm behaving like a schoolgirl. I have a boyfriend who's lovely but I cannot stop thinking about my cousin. We have been involved romantically in the past. He was in love with me once but we just couldn't get it off the ground then. There's huge chemistry there. Others notice it, even when they've no idea we used to date. I'm seeing him tomorrow, just as friends. He is not my ideal life partner or anything but he does something to me. I'm listening to a song over and over right now that makes me think of him. Silly girl... I have a lovely boyfriend. Life is weird.
