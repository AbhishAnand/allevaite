Waste

What a waste of my time. I never want you to ever waste another minute of my life ever again. All you ever do is tear me down as a person, tell me about all the wild things you've been doing (when I couldn't care less!) and then call me your friend. I don't know why I ever liked you. I don't know why I ever dated you. I don't know why I decided to help you with this project so you could go ask someone else and give them my portion of the check. You're a jerk.
