My grandmother is dying

i have a choice to visit my grandmother before she passes, she is not well and is overcome with cancer, the last i saw of her she could still be made to laugh, now she can't stand or function on her own and her days are very near, my heart wants to remember her as i last saw her, but i'm torn with the decision to witness her end, i want to support her and am fearful of my last chance to say goodbye, is my heart telling me the truth or is fear steering me away, what would my creator advise me to do with this very difficult choice
