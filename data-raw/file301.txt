I'm a bad person

I've been with my guy for 3 years now, and most of the time, all I do is fantasize about other men. Exes, his friends, random bar guys, celebs - you name it. I guess I just wonder if that's normal...or if maybe I'm too young to get married. The problem is, I love him more than anything in the world. He is the best person for me, and I know that, I just wish I could stop thinking about other guys. It makes me feel so bad. But I haven't ever and wouldn't ever cheat on him. Am I a bad person?
