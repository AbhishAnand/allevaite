A confession about me.

Mine's not so much of a confession of something i've done, it's a confession about me. In all honesty i don't like myself that much. not in a pitying kind of a way, just in a sense that i feel like i do everything wrong. i don't understand myself, i hate the way i do things and what i think. i always seem to fall really deep when i fall for a guy. i want to see them and when i see them i'm happy. but then it feels like they never want to see me as much. and i constantly feel really annoying. i just look at myself and all i can see is a fat joke. i can be too defensive sometimes, but then again i let people walk all over me. i think i'm pretty then i think i'm unnattractive when i see someone better or an imperfection. i pick at my face because i want it to look nice but it's NEVER nice enough, and then when it is nice i ruin it because i can't look nice. i don't get work done, i get lazy, i'm not smart academically and when i find something i'm good i realise i'm just another fish in the sea. i love my boyfriend but i'm scared of me chasing away, i don't let him in on all of this but if i ever slip up and get a little emotional i get scared he'll now want to break up with me. my boyfriend before him broke up with me because he didn't like any emotional stuff and because i wanted to see him more than twice a week. i give up. i can't seem to be able to do anything right.
