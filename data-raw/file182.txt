In love with my wifes best friend

So, about ten years ago, in high school I was dating this one girl. She introduced me to some of her friends the summer we started dating. I immediately fell in love with one of her friends. About ten months later when we broke up, I still felt strongly about her friend. We were sort of friends at the time, and a few months later, I told her how I felt. Unfortunately for me, she didn't feel the same way. Few years later she hooked me up with one of her friends. We dated for several years and are currently married with one child. Now the girl I fell in love with moved away, and I was able to ignore my feelings for her. But now she's back in town with her own child (she's still single) and I'm still in love with her. Can't say I really know what to do. We work together now, and are planning on a starting a band of sorts together. I want to tell her so bad how I feel, but I fear (and I believe rightfully so) that it'll just backfire and ruin everything. I know most would say just stay with my wife, but I don't know that I can. I don't plan on cheating whatsoever, and if everything goes bad I'll file for custody of my child. But it still doesn't change what I feel for her friend.
