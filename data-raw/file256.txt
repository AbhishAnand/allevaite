I did love her

I just broke up with my fiancee after 6 months. We were dating for almost 5 years. I thought I could change her, but I guess you can't change another person. She wanted more of me, I wanted more of life. I never meant to hurt her, and all I can do is think about her. I know this will pass, but it still hurts. Always been a big fan of the 'tough-guy' act, -- I'm pulling it off with an Oscar-worthy performance. Or maybe not, I am talking to a computer screen instead of anyone else...
