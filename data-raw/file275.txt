I can't stand you. I won't call.

I can't sleep because i feel bad about the fact that you're such a rockhead. You make me feel guilty for "not giving it a chance" when there was nothing to give a chance to! No common interests, viewpoints, sentiments. You have no worldview, you are selfish, and prefer to spend time on the computer/TV/crackberry. You are so tactless about what you do & say and then blame me for reacting by saying stuff like "you're too sensitive" or "you're responsible for your own actions". You have the mentality and vocabulary of a 12 yr old. If you don't know something to be true, then it's not and you dispute it and twist it around until I don't know what we're arguing about. Yet you still want to give it a chance. Are you an idiot? Good luck finding a woman who will stand you. You need to figure out a lot about communication and women. Read a newspaper or book once in a while, lose weight. So maybe I can sleep. I will not stop looking for a man who gets it. You are not it. The only regret I have is that I can't tell you that you don't get it. You're too arrogant anyway.
