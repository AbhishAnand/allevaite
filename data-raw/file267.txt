forever loved

Ive been in love with this girl for as long as i knew how to love. I've known her for almost 8 years and I'm 13. we call one another our best friend, and i think she likes me back. I can't get the nerve to tell her how i feel but my heart is calling for her and i know it. If it doesn't work out our relationship as it is now may be gone forever. i love her too much to do that. i just want to be with her every moment of my life.
