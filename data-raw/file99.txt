After a panic attack.

I remember once, on my birthday, my mother chased me with a knife in her hands, screaming, "I'm going to kill you!" I had turned twelve at the time and I locked myself in my room, wondering why my mother hated me. I had suffered so much from her abuse and I am still chronically depressed. At the time, I did not know what to do and my whole body trembled. I found the sharpest item in the room, a scissor, and cut myself on my thigh. I can still remember the ribbons of blood flowing from my skin onto my bed.
