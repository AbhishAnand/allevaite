Never going to happen.

My brother has this friend which I found very attractive from the first time we met which was like 5 years ago? I was always really geeky and dorky around him but I didn't know better. Two years ago, my brother went to work abroad and invited me to visit him in the foreign country he was in. I went and his friend happened to have gone to visit him there, too. The whole time I was geeky and dorky and slowly and subtly starting to feel things for him. The time we spent together started meaning more and more. There was almost this romantic tension when we were alone but nobody would do anything. I think my brother saw a bit of the tension so he tried to be present whenever he could. Now this hot friend has a girlfriend who he's gone traveling a few times with and I'm pretty sure they're going to end up together for another while. Breaks my heart a little bit but because I fell for him in such a subtle way, my mind prepared to discover that he had a good girlfriend. If only I could phone him and it not be weird...
