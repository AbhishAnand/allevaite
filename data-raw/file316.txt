Over Analyzing?

so i just found out that my boyfriend's ex and her brother, who was his best friend back in the country where he grew up (before moving here when he was 16) share the same birthday as my sister and my mom. i've always thought that it was unfair to his ex that he was forced to move here and when he met me, i felt as if i became another barrier to their relationship even though they broke up a good two years before we met. i never found out much about his life back then because i was afraid that i might find out things that would make me feel very insecure. i have a gut feeling that his ex was his great love (everyone's gotta have one unforgettable love right?) and i can never be loved as much as she was. i must confess that my love for him is unaltered even after thoughts (of which were my own) that i am not the one he loved the most. in fact at most times i feel like i am another barrier separating him and her. i love him so much but these crazy thoughts are seriously screwing with me. maybe i'm over analyzing it too much. he has been a WONDERFUL boyfriend to say the least. we've been together for almost 3 years and our families have met. marriage is on the cards. everything is just perfect. on the surface. i have this crazy crazy feeling that i'm not really the one he loves the most even though he has told me countless of times that i am the best he's ever had. but come on, ALL my boyfriends say that. it's not even counted anymore. haha. guys just say anything to make a girl feel good. even if it's a lie. and every time my sister and my mom celebrates a birthday, i am reminded of this life he once had and the people he loved whom he left years ago. i feel like i am the third party even though i am the girlfriend right now. this is insane isnt it? it's 4am and this is running through my head. is anyone even reading this? god. i need to get out. i need someone to slap me silly.
