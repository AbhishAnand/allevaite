Love at first sight

Ive been in love with a girl ever since the first day I laid eyes on her years ago when I was in school with her, we had the odd kiss etc but I never built up the courage to tell her how I really felt, I was only about 15 at the time and I really did think Id get over it, I put it down to growing up and thought Id be able to move on and it was just one of those things you had to experience growing up. Ive since tried moving on, Ive got a girlfiend now who I have bought a house with and really do not want to hurt, but I cant get this girl out of my head, I still dream about her and its eating me up inside, I ache for her so much it hurts and I really feel the need to tell her just how much I love her after all of these years. As I said, I dont want to cause any harm, but Ive been thinking about maybe just sending her some flowers, just to let her know that someone (me) really loves her and adores her......good idea or bad idea? I really need some closure and to get this off my chest one way or another because I cant carry this around keeping it to myself any longer, im 26 years old now and these feeling for her just wont pass no matter how much I try and put her out of my head.
