I got that girl fired

I don't think it's really a confession, and I don't feel bad about it, but I got a girl fired from my job. She is honestly a bad person, and my company was paying her $16/hour to sit on her butt and look at Myspace. Her not doing her job was interfering with my job, so I went all cloak and dagger with it and got her fired. We were 'supposed' to be 'friends', but I actually hated her. I think it's unfair for people like that to basically get away with murder their whole lives. She started rumors about me after she put two and two together. Let's just say I wouldn't bat an eyelash to burning her house down and stab her ashes. Hope she has fun in hell someday.
