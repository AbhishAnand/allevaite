Scared to move on with my life

I have been with my husband for close to 6 years now. When I married him I really didn't want to get married again. Since we have been married, we have had 2 beautiful daughters who are 5 and 3. I do not love my husband. During a recent trip to FL, I cheated on him with an old friend from HS and fell for the guy. I am now secretly stealing money out of our account for plans to move back to FL where I am from. I am scared my husband will try and take my little girls away from me. He has threatened me with it before. I am scared of him. He has said he would put my body in a cornfield. He has shoved me and threatened bodily harm and dragged me through the house by my hair.
