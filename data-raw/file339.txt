my biggest regret

I have a great guy friend who I know deep down I'm in love with. 3 years ago we did a lot of clubbing together and then one night he asked me to go home with him. I was really inexperienced at the time and in a panic I said maybe it wasn't a good idea. Well he felt like a total jerk for it and never came on to me again. I got a boyfriend not long after but always wished I could have this guy instead. Now my boyfriend and I are really serious, and my guy friend has a great girlfriend. But I still no deep down that I'd do anything to be with him. I love everything about him, he's the ideal man. I'm going to regret saying no to him for the rest of my life.
