Roomate

This isn't much of a confession, but I freakin hate my roommate. His is one of those guys that finds some way to annoy me in any way possible. For instance, it is a daily experience to find him snickering at his desk, only to look over at me waiting for me to ask what is so funny. I can usually hold out for about 4 minutes until I give in and he shows me some bit of internet humor that I discovered in the 8th grade. I bought some nice over-ear headphones, I never use them to listen to music, just to ignore what he is doing. Anyway, I could write a lengthy post on everything he does that annoys me (including how he is explaining to me how he needs to moisturize his feet more, and repeatedly asking me if I know a good foot moisturizer), but I don't have the will power to relive every annoyance, and not kill him. I'm moving into a private room in 2 weeks. Now I just wonder what new hell awaits me every morning until then. So the confession part of this, is that he is really a nice guy, but I mess with him all the time, just because I hate him so much. Yesterday I installed a trojan on his computer. Pretty lame confession, but he is such a mongrel idiot, I had to let someone know. Thanks for understanding.
