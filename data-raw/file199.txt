drive myself mad

i do this all the time, unable to turn around this feeling inside my head that somethings going to go wrong. and that its going to be my fault. or his. but im just so scared. always anxious. thinking. about him. and wishing i could just be thinking about happy stuff or other stuff...just not all this bad stuff. why? why? why? why? why do i do what i do? what do i have to be told, how do i have to be held, touched, to know that "everything's ok"? i want that feeling, but i feel so terrible at the mean and annoying ways i try to get that feeling. asking questions...making faces. feeling low. i feel terrible and want to make it all up to him. he has done wrong but i know that this larger hump in our feelings, is all me. i have to make him feel at ease. i have to let him know that i AM happy, that this IS what i want. i can do it...i just know ive messed up again yesterday. texted too long, wrote an email. immed. i shouldve just shut my mouth. closed my laptop. not written to him. but i couldnt. i had to hear from him. and then i let it make me feel worse. all because he didnt call me "baby". and why is that important? and why on earth does that make me cry?? i have to stop treating him this way. i will. i just hope he sticks around after yesterday and all the dumb crap i said like a desperate fool.
