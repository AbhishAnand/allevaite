Still Crave my Ex

My ex-wife, Hispanic, shapely, remarried an anglo dude. He was younger that she. I wish them well, but I still have the hots for her and I still crave her. She was my high school sweetheart. She was/is awesome! But, she cheated on me and our life together ended. I don't blame her for cheating, I was young then, immature and didn't pay much attention to her like I should have. Someone else (an attorney she worked for) did and she fell. She now has a son, lives in Texas and I still love her sooooo much. I know she knows that because she feels uncomfortable the times I have contacted her either by phone or by email. I was sorry to hear that her mom had passed away. I cried for her and her pain. When my wife died, she sent me a card expressing her condolences. I was so moved by that. I don't know if she still feels anything for me. I know she's made a life with her present husband but I know that she should have had a better life. Her husband is away from her a lot of the time and I know that can not be very healthy for her relationship. Love, I know that you know, that I still love you so much.... and I always will. We had some very difficult times, but I also remember some very, very good times and the "munchies" we shared together. Who knows, maybe someday, in this life, we could have a chance to be together again. I don't count on it, but I do wish it could happen. Even if it was in the later years of our life, I wouldn't mind. I would be a better partner this time around. I have matured and learned so much to share with you. I love you... please take good care of yourself and I hope you're still interested in singing and still love to play the guitar.
