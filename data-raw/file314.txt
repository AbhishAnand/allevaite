jealousy over things I can't help

When ever I see an asian woman with a white guy I secretly can't stand the sight! I have asian girl friends who date white guys and I put on the best show of tolerance and happiness for them. But deep down inside I think of the white guys are pathetic for this as if asian women are some new trend or arm candy. I know deep down inside it's because I'm jealous of asians interested in whites... and wonder if an asian man will ever be interested in me... a girl from the carribean...Pathetic.
