the towel

my roomate was such a jerk. She constantly got mad about the tiniest stuff. I mean like for instance you move her laundery or leave the light on at night she would cuss you out for it. On top of that she thought it was okay to move my stuff around and go into my room without permission. That stupid idiot wanted the air conditioner on 80 degress in the middle of the summer in texas. To top it off if I tried to make it even a little bit cooler she would yell at me. So the day I was moving out my boyfriend had to take a leak but he managed to piss all over the toliet seat and wiped it up with her towel.
