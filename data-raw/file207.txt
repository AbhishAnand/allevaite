I still love him

I still love him, even after all this time. I probably always will love him too. The curls of his hair, his pink, juicy lips, his soft, sweet voice, his amazing sense of humor, his kindness, and his deep blue eyes, deep as the ocean. I would look into them all day if I could. I still love you, T, and I'll never stop loving you. Even if you aren't gay, I can't help myself, I care too much. Please let us meet one day.
