stupid

I was at work and thought I would be cool and went in a back room to sleep. I set my cell phone to wake me up. The cell phone woke me and I fell back asleep. The next thing I know the supervisor called me on a cell phone to open a door so he could come in (morning). A real dumb mistake. He was nice about it (I think) I have got in trouble before and actually got fired for sleeping. I think I am going down the toilet again as far as trying to better my life.
