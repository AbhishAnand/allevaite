I hate Skye

I hate Skye and all those jerks I went to high school with. In 3 years time it will be our 10 year high school reunion. I hope that they are all fat, ugly and in low paying dead end jobs. And that by then I am successful and beautiful and married to a great, intellegent, wealthy man who has made some awesome scientific discovery that has changed mankind for the better. Better yet, I hope I made the discovery...we can both make discoveries. I'll settle for happy, successful and beautiful though.
