I need her next to me

I have a giant crush on another female in the building where I work. She is the reason I get out of bed, and go to work. I have never wanted to be with anyone as much as I want her. Problem #1 is she's married. Problem #2 is she's going to be the death of me. I'm required to do a lot of driving, and I can't concentrate on the task at hand. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that being with her would be close to impossible, but I can dream, and believe me when I say I do. She's gorgeous (her eyes could melt the polar ice caps), smart, and witty. And if I die in a car wreck, and she's the last thing on my mind... then what a way to go. Who knows, maybe dreams can come true. I'm hoplessly hooked.
