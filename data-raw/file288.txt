ex-friend

There was this guy that i fell in love with. we got on so well, and we'd always have the best time together. he said that he felt atracted to me, but since we were heading off to different universities, we shouldn't start a relationship. We went to our separate universities, but we still maintained a close friendship. Although he would date other guys (usually right before i would visit him), i still was very much in love with him, and i did mention it a couple of times and everytime he would say that i meant a lot to him and that he was attracted to me but that we shouldn't do anything. eventually, it came to the point where i felt that i should cut contact with him, because i couldn't stop myself from liking him. i told him this and we planned a good-bye visit. the visit went well, we had dinner and watched some movies, but when it came for him to leave i was hoping for somewhat of an emotional response. i walked him to his bus, all the while hoping he'd say something, maybe beg me to reconsider. he didn't. he got on the bus without even giving me a hug and just left. It's been months since i last saw/ spoke to him. Now, i despise him for not making more of an effort to try and keep me in his life. he makes me feel worthless. sometimes, i imagine myself going to his house and stabbing him and then killing all of his uni mates bare handed for somehow changing him and taking him from me. the most tragic thing though is that i really miss him.
