unsure

this will be hard to put in words... once, i liked this girl A. this went on for a year or so. up till now i still can't explain why it happened. during that 1 year, i was once asked who i liked. strangely, 2 names came to my mind. A and B. again i don't understand why. now, i'm fully over A. but i found myself liking B more and more. i think B know it now. friends tease us about it. i don't know how she feels. i don't even know if its normal for me to feel this weird things. and i don't know whether i should continue. i'm just a stressed out teenager man.
