Discreet at Faire

I work at a renaissance faire as a vendor, meaning I sell stuff to people who don't want to buy anything; it's a fun job, though. Anyway. Here's the story. I was hawking to the crowd, trying to convince someone to come and look at my stock, when this hot, young-looking black girl comes over and says "OK, so show me what you've got." 15195"
