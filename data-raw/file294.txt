Best Friend

Even though everyone thinks our friendship is perfect, I secretly HATE my best friend. She's one of those trampy, "codependant" girls, who always run back to a guy even though they treated the girl like trash. She goes around calling herself "emo", even though everyone knows she's a poser. The only reason I haven't stopped being her friend is because I don't want to throw away the friendship we have had since 2nd grade.
