burden

My mother is a huge burden. I love her so much, but I think my resentment towards her is getting out of control. I've been taking care of her my whole life, but since I started collage 6 years ago she's been like my child. I pay her bills, handle her problems. I can't deal with it much longer, but without me I know she'll kill herself. I wake up every morning clenching my teeth I'm so stressed out, I don't know how it will all end.
