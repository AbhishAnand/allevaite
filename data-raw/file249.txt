Being a fake

found a good looking person pictures online, faked being them, found love, hope he doesn't find out i'm not really the guy of his dreams and i'm actually a she. been doing this for almost 3 years...its not that i want to be a man or anything, its just....being someone i'm not is so much more interesting than being me.
