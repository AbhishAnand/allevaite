Four Years

I've been in love with this guy for four years and even though he has moved on and i'm living good everyday i think about him. i pray for him more than i pray for myself. I know that he's happy but it doesn't make me happy because he's not happy with me he's with someone else. I love him so much, i'll give anything for the love and affection he shows her even though she doesn't deserve it. We haven't talk in like two years but i know him because he's one of my best friend's brother, but every time it's his birthday i call and say Happy birthday, this year i called and he just asked who is this and it killed me. i wake up in the middle of the night and just think about him. it's so bad now that i'm asking people how to fall out off love with somebody because it's killing me slowly. I don't want to cry anymore because i'm not with him, some tell me how to fall out of love...
