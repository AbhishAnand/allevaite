Why

I had know him for about a year when we started dating. We were really good friends, and all of a sudden, when he was gone, I missed him, like, extremely, and everytime I would think of him, I'd get the cliche love feelings. Well, we started dating, and it only lasted for nine days because he said he was confused. I felt more love for him, than I did my previous fiance..
