lost it

I am spun out on Ritalin. It helped me study at first but now it makes my heart feel all messed up. I can't stop taking it without staying in bed all day. Trying to learn advanced mathematics on legal speed has made me lose my mind. I'm broke. I have a great idea but I can't summon the will power to carry it out. I am so confused about everything. I have nothing to show for the last six years. What happened to me?
