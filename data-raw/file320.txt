we've got a big big mess

it was a sunday that my boyfriend and i spent the entire day together. it was that saturday that i first got the feeling of impending doom in the pit of my stomach. like something bad was going to happen. like i was going to have to break up with him some time in the near future. i lied and told him i just felt off and i felt so horrid that he was trying so hard to make me smile and all i did was scowl, that by the time we were talking back to my house from the local shop-ko, i was laughing and smiling because i reverted back to being his best friend instead of his girlfriend, if only in my own mind. when we got back to my house, i felt the same - gloomy, tired, irritated, and like a meteor was hurtling towards earth. over the next few days, i'd texted and talked back and forth with my best friend to try and work out my feelings instead of just talking to him. it was a wednesday afternoon when i parted with him at the bus stop and feeling like the feeling had passed - i didn't want to lose him or leave him. i wanted him to be my boyfriend, and i wanted to enjoy it. i wanted to be happy. it was the very next day that my brother took me aside and told me he was in jail for domestic abuse against his ex girlfriend the night before. i didn't cry. strangely not, perhaps i should have. he got out that afternoon. i didn't feel too affected, even after i had to recount the events to my mother and my sister. i didn't cry when i knew i would have to break up with him. i didn't want to cry. i'd had enough crying. when i called him later that night, i ended up crying. and i hated him for it. because i'd had enough crying. i'm done crying. no matter how unloveable it makes me.
