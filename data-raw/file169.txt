I hate my sister

I know it sounds really bad, but she is someone that I can't stand to be around. She is three years younger than me. I have to live in the same house as her. She is disgusting and just down-right mean. I don't even try to get along with her anymore, its useless. The little sister that I used to know is dead to me. Most people don't even know we're related. We don't even speak to each other while we're in the same house.
