In love with my best friend

I have been married for 10 years, and met a guy online 2 years ago. It finally hit me today what I had been suspecting for several months...I love this man. I have children with my husband, and while my husband isn't a bad father, he's not the best spouse, and while I don't know if my friend would be a good father, he's interested in my children, and interested in me. I never meant for this to happen, but I love him, and I think he loves me.
