I've never had a friendship mean more to me. I've always been afraid to express emotion. I'm scared to death of losing you. I don't like her in anyway, but for you, I'll go through anything. I wish you could open your eyes and see that. Patience is a virtue, and I curse the boy that first told me that. I'll be here forever, unless you tell me different. Can we just talk? I love you.
