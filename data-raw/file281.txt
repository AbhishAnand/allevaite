James Bond, Fireman

When I was a child - maybe I was about 9 or 10 years old, there was a fire round the back of my mates house. We were cheeky little kids, but we were a little bit in awe of real firemen, so we went up to them and asked for their autographs. When we handed the scrap of paper to the third fireman, I noticed a smirk on his face, so I examined the signatures. Apparently the fire had been put out by Mickey Mouse, James Bond and some other fictional character I no longer recall. At first I was a bit upset about being duped. I felt like getting my own back on them. But then I realised, I already had. After all, it was us that started the fire.
