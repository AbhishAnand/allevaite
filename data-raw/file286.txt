Season

I feel like someone's ripped my heart from my chest. Hey, you still there? I just needed to say. Give you a heads up.At this point, that feeling of doom, that feeling of please don't say what I think your gonna say, centred in my chest, I stop breathing, for an eternity, waiting for you to tell me forever. I wait. I might be going away for a while. Okay now what do I do Can I be your friend? Can I see you again? Knowing in my heart all the time, You want my help, You want my advice, You want me because I am stranger, Because I'm objective, I am objective. I don't exist. Thing is, I am real. My whole world has been filled with rose and joy since I've met you, I cant sleep, I can't eat, I hang on your every word, you make me smile, you make me laugh, I want to make you better when your sad, you've made me come alive, you've reminded me i'm not cold, I'm not frozen up. You came to me and now your going. But I wont let fear take me, And I wont make the same mistakes again, You make me happy, Even if its just for today, Cause in the end, that's all we have. now. So now, I'm going to be fearless. Because I know you'll pass like the seasons. Better to regret what I did, rather than what I never tried.
