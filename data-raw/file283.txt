Gambling

I have lost 1000 dollers today and i think over 7000 dollers in total in the last 3 years in poker machines. I am kind of got addicted to it. Also now i withdraw cash from my credit card to quench my thirst for gambling.. i have lost my self esteem and i don't see my self as good person any more. There are such a lot of good things i could have done with that money for my family or friends or any one who needs money.. to make things worse i lie about all these small things to my family.. i really feel to get out of this and get back my life.. I am going to do all that possible to get things straight in my life and use the time/money to good things.
