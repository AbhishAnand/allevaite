crush

I have a crush on this girl that is in my biology class. every day I look forward to class just to see her. It's sad but I can't seem to muster the courage to tell her how I feel about her. This is my senior year in high school and I have very little time to tell her before graduation. If that happens then I am afraid that I will never see her again and tell her my feelings.
