Getting Over My Ex

I tell people, my current and prior girlfriends included, that I'm over her. It's a massive, massive lie. I'm still in love with her. She's moving in her current boyfriend, marriage is looming for them, and I still would do or give anything to be back with her. Every time we talk, I get depressed. Just thinking about her is enough to ruin a day with trying not to cry and hurt myself. It's been this way for years and I don't think this will ever change. Honestly, I'd rather die than keep living like this.
