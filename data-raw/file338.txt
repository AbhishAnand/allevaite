Mom is a burden

My dad left my mom 5 years ago when I was 20. Mom was sick at the time so I had to work while in collage and pay all the bills. I thought mom would bounce back in a year or two but she didn't at all, she didn't even seem to try. Now her health is fine but she is totally depressed and defeated. She doesn't work, she has no money, and depends on me for everything. I love her so much and would never dream of not caring for her, but I hate that I'm 25 and burdened by this. I can't move out of the city even though I'd love to go see the world. She calls me at least once a week and totally depresses me. If I don't go visit her for a few days in a row she gets practically suicidal. And what makes it worse is my older sister doesn't do half of what I do, she''s going to get married and move soon and leave me with all the responsibility. I just wish I could be free to live my life and that mom could be a happy, productive person.
