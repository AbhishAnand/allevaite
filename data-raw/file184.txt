Job

She made sure my contract wasn't renewed. Everyone on staff loved me though. I did such a great job! She always hated me and made sure I got the chop. I think about waiting for her after work and beating her up. She makes like 90 thou a year, right now I'm stuck looking for another job. I hate how this world is so unfair.
